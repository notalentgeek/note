* Here is how to get the latest version of codes from the main branch in a Git based repository.

```markdown
git reset --hard HEAD
git pull
```

* The first lines `git reset --hard HEAD` is used to discard all uncommitted changes.
* Then finally the `git pull` is used to get latest codes from the main branch.
* I got this information from this StackOverflow discussion, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6335681/git-how-do-i-get-the-latest-version-of-my-code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6335681/git-how-do-i-get-the-latest-version-of-my-code).
