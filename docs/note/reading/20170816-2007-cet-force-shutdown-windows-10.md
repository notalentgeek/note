* There was an error that makes me unable to join a game in Steam version of Titan Quest Anniversary Edition.
* The fix is to actually to fully shutdown Windows 10 (full shutdown the operating system).
* Windows 10 is designed to be not fully shutdown (to make it able to be booted fast). This hinders some programs to be fully stopped.
* Here is the command for Windows 10 to be able fully shutdown.

```markdown
shutdown /s /f /t 0
