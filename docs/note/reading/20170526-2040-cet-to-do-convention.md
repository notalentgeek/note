* This note is my starting point to make grand to - do list.
* I think it would be better if I make a separate project to conclude all of my to - do list.
* To - do list needs to be leveraged with semantic patterns. This is my personal example.
    * Make food (minimal pattern).
    * Make food for/from/to/(any prepositions) dog/home/.../(any connected object).
* Example on full to - do list semantic pattern.
    * Make food for my dog in the morning.
* Primary preposition is followed by arbitrary adjectives.
* The arbitrary adjectives follow 4W + 1H ("what" is used as the primary deliverable of the to do list). This is the order.
    1. How (always followed with "by ...").
    1. When (always starts with "at ..." or "on ...").
    1. Where (always starts with "at ...", "in ...", or "on ...").
    1. Who (always starts with "for ...").
1. Why (always starts with "because ...").
