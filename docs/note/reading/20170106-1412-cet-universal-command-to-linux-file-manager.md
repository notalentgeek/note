* Here is how to open Raspbian Jessie file manager with `sudo`.
* The default file manager for Raspbian Jessie is `xdg-open`.
* No! Actually command `xdg-open` is to open something (file or folder) with default file manager.
* So this command will works with most Linux distribution regardless what the file manager is (Dolphin, Thunar, it does not matter).
* In order to open with super user privilige use this command `sudo xdg-open /path/to/file/or/folder`.
