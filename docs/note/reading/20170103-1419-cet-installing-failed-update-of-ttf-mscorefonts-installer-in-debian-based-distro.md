* In my case, there was a point of which my Ubuntu MATE failed to install update of `ttf-mscorefonts-installer`.
* Usually it can be done with `sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer`. But for some reason the link to the binary blob was missing (404). I guess that is SourceForge faults.
* But nevertheless, if you experience this update error as well you can just down the .deb installer in here, [https://packages.debian.org/jessie/all/ttf-mscorefonts-installer/download](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/all/ttf-mscorefonts-installer/download).
* By installing the .deb file, there was no update error in my Ubuntu MATE anymore.
