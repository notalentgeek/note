* Pebble shows us on how to manage competition with other smart watch like Android Watch or Apple Watch.
* The main idea is to create a flexible platform that can be low as possible (the barebone minimum) and can also be build as magnificent as the developers want.
* For example in this case Android Watch and Apple Watch comes a lot of features. These features will make their device hard to be scaled down. While in the other hand Pebble watch that start from the barebone minimum can easily adjust features of the smart watch and then the price.
* Pretty clever explanation in my opinion.

* Pebble is an open system that is not tied to either Android or Apple.
* It can be used within both environment quite well.

* When you take some features (in this example Pebble reduced the battery life) you need to make sure you give additional or more features.
* When the new Pebble created with reduced battery life than the previous Pebbles, the developers decided to add super charging feature that let the watch can be charged to 80% within 15 minutes.

* From this excerpt above, we can learn from Pebble that when making an operating system the user interface need to be regulated.
* Especially in limited display like in Pebble watch.
* In this scenario Pebble need to adjust by giving new guidelines for its developers to create interface of their Pebble watch application.

* When your company sunk, create some prioritizes on what to protect.
* For example in Pebble case. The CEO prioritizes these.
    * Developers.

* Pebble choose to be bought by fitBit because they promise Pebble to keep some of their customers and the developers.
