* I got this article from my Reddit thread here, [https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/5x1rfk/how_can_i_just_work_uninterrupted_all_the_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/5x1rfk/how_can_i_just_work_uninterrupted_all_the_time/).
* For my Reddit thread itself there are some tips that is "make sense" to me.
    * Make sure to have full screen when doing something with computer. More spaces those are not relevant to what I am currently doing mean more distraction.
    * When doing Pomodoro break please walk away from the desk.
