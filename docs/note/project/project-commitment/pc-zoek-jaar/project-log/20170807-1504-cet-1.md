* Concatenate array in JavaScript, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat).
* Example codes.

```markdown
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [4, 5, 6];
var array3 = array1.concat(array2);
// After that `array3` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
```

* There is `func.apply()` from `object` to fill `func()` with parameters.
* Here is the example codes that will print "hello world" in the console.

```markdown
var args = ["hello", "world"];
function test (_arg1, _arg2) { console.log(_arg1 + " " + _arg2); }
test.apply(this, args);
```

* This is the reference for `func.apply()`, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply).
* In P5JS use `strokeWeight()` to adjust stroke thickness. For example `strokeWeight(10)` will set the next shape as 10 pixels thick.
* In P5JS use `cursor()` to change the pointer type into browser (then operating system) cursor.
* For example the default is `cursor(ARROW)`, but for shape intended as a button `cursor(HAND)` can be used.
* There are `ARROW`, `CROSS`, `HAND`, `MOVE`, `TEXT`, or `WAIT`. The parameter can be a path to an image as well to be used a custom cursor.
* Example of default mode rectangle shape with P5JS.

```markdown
rect(0, 0, 10, 10); // The last two parameter are the width and height.
rect(0, 0, 10, 10, 10); // The last parameter is the radius of of rounded corners.
/* More specific rounded corners.
The last 4 parameters are: top - left, top - right, bottom - right, and then
bottom - left. */
rect(0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10);
```

* I made general function to remove letters in a string.

```markdown
function removeLetters (_string, _rmString, _all) {
  if (_all === undefined) _all = true;

  if (_all) return _string.split(_rmString).join("");
  else return _string.replace(_rmString, "");
}
```

* If `_all` is `true` then delete all occurrences of `_rmString` in `_string`.
* For example `"asdasd".split("a").join("")` will return `"sdsd"`.
* If `_all` is `false` then delete one (the first) occurrences of `_rmString` in `_string`.
* For example `"asdasd".replace("a", "")` will return `"sdasd"`.
* So this is actually more flexible than Python's `str.replace()`.
* These are codes to remove n amount of letter from the end of string.

```markdown
var str = "123asd";
str = str.substring(0, str.length - 3);
```

* The codes above will return `"123"`.
* The `- 3` can be adjusted to as to how many letter will be deleted from the end of string.
* In P5JS there is `textWidth()` to get the width of a text in pixels. The current configurations (font, size, ...) will be used as for the calculation. So, it is the best to have this inside a class or right after the text rendered into HTML5 `<canvas>`.
* Here is the reference for `textWidth()`, [https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textWidth](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textWidth).
* Here are some example of dictionary usage in JavaScript.

```markdown
var exmplDict = { text1:"hello", text2:"world" };
```

* In P5JS to convert `keyCode` (from `keyPressed`) into character can be done using `String.fromCharCode()`. Where the first argument is the keyboard button code itself. This is the StakOverflow reference, [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3977792/how-to-convert-keycode-to-character-using-javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3977792/how-to-convert-keycode-to-character-using-javascript).
* In JavaScript, the `keyup` and `keydown` event cannot detect if a keyboard input returns capital letter or lower letter. However, the `keyPressed` event can detect case sensitive inputs.
