* When I developed this application, I tried to look for a word generator.
* At the end I reached and agreed that Wordnik API is the best I could get.
* Although there are some parameters those I need but not available in Wordnik API, the workaround can still be found.
* Here is the link into Wordnik API for each possible programming language, [http://developer.wordnik.com/#!/libraries](http://developer.wordnik.com/#!/libraries).
* However, there is no Wordnik library for HaXe at that point.
* So, what I did was to create a separate Python script for my HaXe program to execute.
