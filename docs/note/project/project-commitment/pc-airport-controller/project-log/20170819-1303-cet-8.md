* Django offers a pleasant way to serve static files like CSS, JS, and other assets.

* For small project this would not be a problem.
* However, Django project itself consists of various applications with various assets (same or not).
* This can be tricky without proper framework to manage the static files.

* Luckily `django.contrib.staticfiles` is there to make this is not a problem.

* Django will automatically search for "static" directory in the root of each application.
* This is similar on how Django finds the "templates" application.

* In the settings.py, `STATIC_FILE_FINDERS` settings contain list of finders that know how to discover static file.
* One of the default finder is `AppDirectoriesFinder` which look for static files in directory in each of the ` INSTALLED_APPS`.

* Similar to template, namespacing is important. Hence inside the static directory there should be another directory named after the application's name.
* In this case, there should be another directory named "polls" inside the static directory.

* The screenshot above is an example on how to load the static file.
* `{% load static %}` means that the `static` is active and it helps constructing an absolute path to the static files.
* Here are example codes to refer to a CSS.

```markdown
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'polls/style.css' %}">
```

* The `static` in `{% static 'polls/style.css' %}` is not available in CSS and JavaScript. Because Django scripting language only for the HMTL file.

* The use of static file manager provided from Django makes it possible to share assets between applications.

* I was wondering what is the `right bottom` in this CSS. Based from the informations I got from [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp), the `right bottom` are meant for the position of the wallpaper.
* Here is the link to the tutorial, [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial06/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial06/).
* Here is the screenshot of the tutorial.
