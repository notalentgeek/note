* This chapter is about developing thesis sentence.
* Thesis sentence is the staring point.
* Thesis sentence needs to be as specific as possible.
* Thesis sentence needs to have a controlling idea.
* Thesis sentence could be made after or before the research.
* There are 2 aspects in defining thesis statement.
    * Advantages.
    * Challenges.
* What is the advantage of this research over other research.
* What is the challenged of this paper.
* If you define your thesis sentence early in the project, you could make your research to be more specific, which is good.
* Thesis statement is one for every research paper.
* Topic sentence is one for every paragraph.
* These sentences should be in full constructed sentence.
* So, what I need to create a lot of topic sentences.
* Please do not do these.
    * Make your topic sentence to broad.
    * Make your topic sentence to specific.
* Too broad topic sentence make it hard to organizing research data.
* Too specific topic sentence make it hard to develop the whole research paper.
* Each paragraph needs to have a main idea. Only one idea! And this is the topic sentence.
* However, usually it is the best idea to just put the topic sentence in the beginning of the paragraph.
