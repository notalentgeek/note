* This chapter is about reviewing research.
* You need to always review your materials.
    * Sometimes to add more.
    * Rarely you would need to remove unnecessary material.
* There are some methods to get faster into writing research paper.
    * Creating outline is a guerrilla list making.
    * Focused free - writing is just like Pomodoro technique but, specifically to force people writing paper.
    * Mind mapping.
* Organizing patterns.
    * Use this separately (?).
    * Or can be used combined with each others.
    * Organizing in particular can be in these manners.
        * Arrange based on the importance.
        * Chronologically/time.
        * Spatial arrangement. Arrange your topic based on the space. Try to create the blueprint description so that your reader can understand what you are trying to explain within your paper.
        * Topics.
* For me the best pre - writing technique would be like these.
    * In the beginning use guerrilla list making.
    * Then use focus free writing.
    * Keep repeat those 2 points above.
    * Then use mind map to arrange as if necessary.
* Make sure to organize the material (I have done this).
