* Here is how you can install PyInstaller.

```mardown
pip install pyinstaller
pip3 install pyinstaller
```

* To upgrade existing PyInstaller.

```markdown
pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
pip3 install --upgrade pyinstaller
```

* PyInstaller is a Python compiler into binary.
* I am not sure if there will be difference between installing PyInstaller using `pip` or `pip3`.
