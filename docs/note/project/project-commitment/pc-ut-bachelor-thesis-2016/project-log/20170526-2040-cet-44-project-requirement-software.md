* Software wise.
* The requirement will be something along what kind of complementary features that would benefit this project's deliverable.
* For this project I set three requirements on software development.
    * Database server.
    * Mobile application client.
    * Physical client.
    * Web client.
    * Web server.
* Draft.
    * For the ideal case scenario all of these are necessary. The most important things are database server and physical client/mobile application client. These define the minimal requirement.
    * The physical client refer to the software development that connects every hardwares mentioned on physical computer requirement __*(refer back to the previously written paragraph about hardware requirements. I think, I titled it as Physical Computing)*__.
    * The mobile application refers to the development of mobile application as the alternative of Sociometric Badge itself. Although, the developer of Future Stack Badge said that the problem lies in the heterogeneity of smart phone on-board sensors. But at least basic functionality multi-modal data gathering like audio and video can still be accessed. The other counter point raised from Carthal Gurrin __*(reference to general paper about lifelogging)*__ that form is matter and social data gathering should be not intrusive. Having form as a smart phone gives different meaning on the device, despite it meant to behave like Sociometric Badge. For testing this should not be matter. However, if the research respondents are not tech aware (for example, kindergarten children, people with neurodegenerative diseases, ...) having proper form is important, since smart phone lost its context as a real-life social data gathering tool. This why the use of smart phone as an alternative itself is discouraged.
    * The database server need not to be a self-hosted database per see. It can also be an embedded one. In general this more refer on the mechanism on where and how the data is stored. At minimal embedded database can formatted as .JSON, .XML, or just a bare .txt without specific format.
* The realistic approach is to develop: physical client, web client, web server, and database server. The physical client is the main deliverable for this project. Web server acts as a mediator between web client as well as to interface database server. The importance of web client lies on the necessity to present data from database in higher level. in higher level.
