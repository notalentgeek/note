* Making legends for the table.
* There are these information that need to be shown up.
    * The 3 borders.
        * Red borders for sense.
        * Green border for wireless communication.
        * Blue for documentations.
    * 3 project types.
        * Commercial.
        * Do it yourself.
        * Research.
    * 20 parameters from 3 kind of classifications (see the 3 borders).
        * 9 for sense.
        * 5 for wireless communication.
        * 6 for documentations.
* Available width is 2790 pixels.
* I need to calculate the necessary white space for texts.
* There are 26 informations.
    * Separate it into 3 lines.
    * Each is 9 informations with last lines only 8 informations.
* Width of the information is 180 pixels.
* Total width without texts 180 pixels x 9 = 1620 pixels.
* This left 2790 - 1620 = 1170 for 9 texts.
* Width per text 1170/9 = it is conveniently 130 pixels!
* Total prototype white mockup rectangle will be 180 + 130 = 310 pixels.
* Perhaps adding width of 60 pixels? 310 - 60 = 250.
* There will be a spare 60 pixels at the end. 60/9 = 6.666
* Total width will be 256.666 pixels.th will be 256.666 pixels.
