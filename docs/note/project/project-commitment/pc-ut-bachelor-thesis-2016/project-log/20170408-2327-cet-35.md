    * There are a framework to develop application for this badge.
    * There is a default Tetris game pre - installed.
    * There is a tutorial on how to program this badge.
    * There is an accelerometer to simulate a simple fluid simulation.
    * This badge has 2 iterations the first one came for Hackaday Belgrade conference, the second one came for Hackaday Supercon conference.

* Meme/Thinking Tag.
    * This project was initiated as Meme Tag then changed into Thinking Tag.
    * In my opinion this Meme/Thinking Tag is similar to real - life Twitter.
    * This tag detect presence of other Meme/Thinking Tag wearer if both are nearby and has the Meme/Thinking Tag facing to each other.
    * As far as I know, Meme/Thinking Tag uses infrared to send information to other Meme/Thinking Tag as well to communicate to the mainstream personal computer. There were no Blutooth nor WiFi at that point.
    * Meme/Thinking Tag has a server to store memes. I think the memes stored from the Meme/Thinking Tag sent to the server by using infrared. There are no USB or any socket mentioned in the part list. Moreover, Bluetooth, USB, and WiFi were not yet popular.
    * The server was written in Perl.
    * Data for State Of The Art.
        * Year originated: 1998.

    * This device is automatically turned on when it has power to do so.
    * This is the currently available consumer solution for data gathering.
    * This is the successor to Vicon Revue and then went alongside with OMG Autographer. Both, Memoto and OMG Autographer was known in nearly in the same time to each other.
    * To take video, the default is by tapping twice at Memoto/Narrative Clip.
    * To turn off, just put Memoto/Narrative clip into your pocket. Or cover the lens. It has light sensor to detect whether it should goes on or off.
    * When this became consumer product it changed name from Memoto into Narrative Clip.
    * When this was still a KickStarter project, the project name is Memoto.

* Microsoft Senscam/Vicon Revue.
    * It has a content management system to manage all data captured with this device.
    * It was first mentioned as a research project from Microsoft named as Microsoft SenseCam.
    * Its first iteration in 2001 was made with a PIC micro - controller.
    * Microsoft SenseCam/Vicon Revue connects via cable (I am not sure what cable it is) to mainstream personal computer.
    * Microsoft SenseCam/Vicon Revue has no wireless communication.
    * Then later, I think, the IP got bought by Vicon a high tech imaging company and then sold as Vicon Revue. It still retain the same functionalities, features, and form from the original Microsoft SenseCam.
    * This is the true lifelogging device.
    * Vicon Revue was priced around 770 USD in 2010.

* New Relic Future Stack Badge.
    * Electric Imp is a stat of the art tools to connect every hardware to the Internet.
    * Electric Imp itself has an extensive administration panel web interface.
    * Electric Imp uses clever method to pair with common smart phone. It uses blink signal from smart phone screen to send shake hand code into the Electric Imp.
    * I think Ruby is the main programming language if you want to develop an IoT app with Electric Imp.
    * I think this was made so that many DIY people could later use data analytics services provided from New Relic.
    * It has Android and iOS communication as it is default in Electric Imp.
    * New Relic Future Stack Badge has a near field communication or NFC as its main wireless connection to transfer data between other New Relic Future Stack Badge.

* nTag.
    * At personal level, nTag can exchange informations within its users.
    * Based from an article from RFID News, nTag is better suited for technology related conferences and events. General conferences and events might be better to put money on the event itself rather than buying and using nTag.
    * Generally used as a tools to simplify logistics at large events and conference.
    * It uses RF to connect to local server. So, within a conference or an event there would be a statically placed computer that acts as a server to store data from RF in the nTag.
    * nTag came as a product from a startup company from MIT Media Arts.
    * nTag can be used to conduct real - time survey.
    * nTag can be used to manage large flow of people within an event or conference.
    * nTag could not be used by its own, but rather in package.
    * nTag is priced around 30 USD to 90 USD.
    * nTag is similar to Meme/Thinking Tag. I suggest that nTag is the realization of Meme/Thinking Tag.
    * nTag new website is [http://www.alliancetech.com/](http://www.alliancetech.com/). However the company is not selling nTag anymore but more into general equipment for conference.
    * nTag owned by the event organizer and should not be owned at personal level.
    * nTag was intentionally as a commercial solution for event organizer to manage conference and event.
    * The nTag main website is a dud.
    * The personal intention is to make people to get into and join conversation easily.
    * The tag line is to enhance networking opportunities.
    * There is a real - time data management.
    * There is a tracking feature as well to detect which room is crowded and which room is not crowded.
    * There is no specific research paper that is about nTag.

* OMG Autographer.
    * I dubbed this as the smarter version of Narrative Clip.
    * It can be automatically taken photos based on inputs from its sensors.
    * It has built - in GPS.
    * It solution to privacy was to make the camera to be apparent to see for anyone that is not the wearer.
    * It uses Bluetooth.
    * OMG Autographer can make animated .gif directly from the device itself.
    * OMG Autographer has an extensive desktop application.
    * OMG Autographer is a middlemen between Vicon Revue and Memoto/Narrative Clip.
    * OMG Autographer is quite pricey for what it was trying to achieve. As general consumer device it was priced for 799 USD, although there were a point it reached 399 GBP, but it is still an expensive device.
    * OMG Autographer uses 136 degree wide angle lens for its camera.
    * The company is, sadly, closed.
    * The intention was as a general lifelogging device.
    * The most packed version for general lifelogging device.
    * The thing that I personally like is that OMG Autographer has a LED matrices user interface that greet the user. So, the wearer and anyone can see if this device is currently recording.
    * There are at least 5 known sensors.
    * There are other implementation as well, like for example for people with neuro degenerative diseases like Alzheimer to help them to develop their surrogate memory.
    * There is a motion sensor for both user and surrounding. For self, it uses accelerometer, for surrounding it uses PIR.
    * There is Android and iOS application.
    * Way better quality compared to Narrative Clip.
    * Data for State Of The Art.

* Rhythm Open Badge.
    * I am not so sure on what kind of sensors it has. The part list does not show proper information. But, from the website, it says that Rhythm Open Badge is able to detect audio, presence, and proximity. The 2 latter ones are with Bluetooth.
    * I think Rhythm is the project name. Whereas Open Badge is the sub - project (the device name).
    * Rhythm Open Badge can be powered with a coin battery.
    * Rhythm Open Badge has 2 versions.
    * Rhythm Open Badge has limited amount of information aside from the website itself.
    * Rhythm Open Badge intended to study human real - life interactivity.
    * Rhythm Open Badge is the newest solution for open source Sociometric Badge.
    * Rhythm Open Badge project is promoted (or supervised) from the same person that initiates Sociometric Badge (Prof. Alex "Sandy" Pentland).
    * Sadly, the term "Open Badge" contradicts with what it is available from Mozilla Foundation's web based Open Badge that is completely unrelated to Rhythm Open Badge. Hence, I refer this as Rhythm Open Badge.
    * The 1st version of Rhyhtm Open Badge is developed using RFDuino. An Arduino compatible development board.
    * The 3rd version of Rhythm Open Badge is developed using NRF51 - DK. A development kit with built - in BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).
    * The open-source hardware badges can be worn by participants around their necks or clipped to their clothing, and measures speaking activity and proximity to other badges.
    * The tutorial and the documentations are still incomplete.
    * The whole project is still ongoing.
    * There is a Google Hangout plug - in. However, Google Hangout is not available anymore.
    * There is a Python based server.
    * There is an Android application to test how Rhythm Open Badge works. However, the features is limited.
    * This project started on 21st January 2016. I know this from the first GitHub commit.

* Sociometer.
    * At basic it has IR to detect face - to - face communication.
    * It capable to detect motion with accelerometer.
    * It has multi - modal audio recording from a small microphone that extract the features from incoming audio.
    * It sends ID data to other facing Sociometer via infrared. This is what determines the face - to - face communication.
    * It uses IR transceiver to detect face - to - face communication.
    * Sociometer is the predecessor of Sociometric Badge.
    * Sociometer was designed as a wearable device. Usually wearable device designed with ambient form in mind. However, unlike any other implementations in this State Of The Art, Sociometer present as an ergonomic shoulder pad. The sense was to make the device ambient to the wearer and not necessarily to be ambient to anyone that is not the wearer.
