* The development of life logging implementations.
    * Throwing technology to the problem.
    * What should have been done is to develop technology specifically for the problem.
* This can be used for the smart phone argument as well.
* There are 2 requirements for these wearable sensors.
    * Robust.
    * Unobtrusive.
* The sensors need to be unobtrusive should detect itself.
* I can quotes and refers to Carthal Gurrin paper with regard to on - board volatile or static memory.
    * "If wearable sensors logs and record data on - board then they need enough storage capacity.".
    * "If wearable sensors logs and record data on - board then they need enough storage capacity.".
    * Updating data wireless need to use the advantage of existing network.
* Process of real - life social data gathering.
* The processes are these.
    * Data collecting.
    * Data cleaning
    * Data aligning (sorting).
    * Signal processing.
* Lack of context! I can mention this in my paper I guess.
* 5Rs of memory access by Sellen and Whittaker.
    * Recollecting.
    * Reminiscing.
    * Retrieving.
    * Reflecting.
* Remembering.lecting.
    * Remembering.
