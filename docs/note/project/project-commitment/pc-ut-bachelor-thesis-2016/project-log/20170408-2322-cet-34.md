* Making the State Of The Art.
* Looking through all possible implementation.
* I think I should somewhere mention where is the Sociometric Badge as a subject located.
    * I meant there are some research paper about lifeloggin as well.
* There would be these.
    * Communications.
    * Sensor.
    * Documentation.
* However, the problem is that communication and sensor could be the same. These are for examples.
    * Bluetooth could be as distance sensor.
    * IR could be as identification sensor.
    * IR could be as local position system.
    * WiFi could be as local position system.
* So, how many total would be communications and sensors.
    * Bluetooth.
    * IR.
    * RF.
    * WiFi.
* Oh no! It is actually different. Sensor is what the device sense.
* Communications is the media of which each of implementations able to connect into different thing.
* Sensor.
    * Audio.
    * Distance.
    * Location.
    * Presence.
    * Proximity.
    * Video.
* There is gesture as well.
* So here would be the all possible sensor.
    * Audio.
    * Distance.
    * Gesture.
    * Location.
    * Presence.
    * Proximity.
    * Video.
* Define the codes, 3 letters no more.
    * Audio, AUD.
    * Distance, DST.
    * Gesture, GES.
    * Location, LOC.
    * Presence, PRE.
    * Proximity, PRX.
    * Video, VID.
* Define the connection methods.
    * Bluetooth, BTH.
    * IR, IR.
    * RF, RF.
    * WiFi, WIF.
* Documentations with its codes.
    * Libraries list, LIB.
    * Parts list, PRT.
    * PCB file, PCB.
    * Research paper, PAP.
    * Schematics, SCH.
    * Source codes, COD.
    * Tutorial, TUT.
* Sort them!
    * COD.
    * PAP.
    * PCB.
    * PRT.
    * SCH.
    * TUT.
* I removed library list because it will be hard to be known for classic project. Moreover it can be inferred from the codes if knowing the libraries is really necessary.
* So, what I want to create here is to attach some implementations.
* I need to determine what kinds of implementation will be in this chapter.
* Let say I have these.
    * Active Badge.
    * DEFCON AND!XOR Unofficial Badge.
    * Meme/Thinking Tag.
    * Microsoft SenseCam.
    * nTag.
    * Queercon Badge.
    * Rhythm Open Badge.
    * Sociometer.
    * Sociometric Badge.
    * Spinner.
    * Uber Badge.
    * Vocera Communication Badge.
* I need to somehow to classify these implementations.
    * We have things that is similar to the Sociometric Device.
    * We have things that could be good to have for my iteration of Sociometric Badge.
    * We have implementations those are for commercial lifelogging products for mainstream.
* What is the simplest thing I can do?
    * To list everything.
* There would be section for honorable mention for thee kind of device.
    * DIY.
    * Commercial.
    * Research.
* No, that would be a bad idea.
* But that is still the simplest idea.
* For commercial products please put the price.
* The implementations are any wearable electronics devices that leverage social interaction.
* Okay, let say rather than doing nothing let me just start on making things.
    * Active Badge.
    * DEFCON AND!XOR Unofficial Badge.
    * Hackaday Belgrade/Supercon Badge.
    * Meme/Thinking Tag.
    * Microsoft SenseCam/Vicon Revue.
    * Narrative Clip.
    * nTag.
    * OMG Autographer.
    * Queercon Badge.
    * Rhythm Open Badge.
    * Sociometer.
    * Sociometric Badge.
    * Spinner.
    * UbER Badge.
    * Vocera Communication Badge.
* Notable implementations.
    * Annual DEFCON electronics badge.
* New sensor update.
    * Audio, AUD.
    * Distance, DST.
    * Gesture, GES.
    * Light, LIG.
    * Location, LOC.
    * Presence, PRE.
    * Proximity, PRX.
    * Temperature, TEM.
    * Video, VID.
* Perhaps change the VID into IMV. As it is in "Image or Video"?
* Add clarification if the device is consumer product or not.
* There is new sensor found in OMG Autographer, which is magnetometer. It used to determine to which direction the OMG Autographer is facing.
* Magnetometer measures magnetism.
* New sensor update.
    * Audio, AUD.
    * Distance, DST.
    * Gesture, GES.
    * Light, LIG.
    * Location, LOC.
    * Magnetism, MAG.
    * Presence, PRE.
    * Proximity, PRX.
    * Temperature, TEM.
    * Video, VID.
* Change gesture into Motion, MOT.
    * Audio, AUD.
    * Distance, DST.
    * Light, LIG.
    * Location, LOC.
    * Magnetism, MAG.
    * Motion, MOT.
    * Presence, PRE.
    * Proximity, PRX.
    * Temperature, TEM.
    * Video, VID.
* Change the meaning of connection and communication with wireless communication.
* Added Future Stack Badge!
* Please state in this chapter that the code meant as a source code. There are some project that gives you example codes to develop and to hack the badge but not to build the badge.
* What is the sense of sensor that can be used as communication as well?
* IR... sending information. So, as long there is a communication then I need to put into wireless communication category.
* There is this book titled, "Social Physics: How Social Networks Can Make Us Smarter". The author is Prof. Alex "Sandy" Pentland.
* According to Mr. Pentland, "human behavior is more predictable than generally thought.".
* This is the article about big data for real - life human social network, [https://singularityhub.com/2016/05/16/mits-sandy-pentland-big-data-can-be-a-profoundly-humanizing-force-in-industry/](https://singularityhub.com/2016/05/16/mits-sandy-pentland-big-data-can-be-a-profoundly-humanizing-force-in-industry/).

* There are some research papers I found.
    * [http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~taemie/papers/200808_AMAM_BWaber.pdf](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~taemie/papers/200808_AMAM_BWaber.pdf), research paper about detecting face to face communication. From reading this paper, I realized on how big and long this overall projects came from. Perhaps, my project would only be a small cog on really top of a big clock tower, but that is a good start I suppose.
    * [http://cba.mit.edu/docs/theses/02.09.fletcher.pdf](http://cba.mit.edu/docs/theses/02.09.fletcher.pdf), research paper about low cost electronics tagging system. Perhaps, this paper useful.

If, perhaps, I need this in the future. Or, I can just reference this to make my paper looks cooler XD. XD.
