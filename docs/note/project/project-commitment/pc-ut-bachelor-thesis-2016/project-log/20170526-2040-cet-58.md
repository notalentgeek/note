* Testing Pedge.
* Testing will be separated into two sections.
    * Making.
    * Using.
* The test of making will be based on the instruction in shell script.
* The test of using is how the user feel about the whole Pedge environment.
* The test of making will be about installing Pedge in Raspberry PI without OpenCV, setting database server, and webserver.
* There will be X routes that I need to manually record the time necessary and if there are hurdles.
