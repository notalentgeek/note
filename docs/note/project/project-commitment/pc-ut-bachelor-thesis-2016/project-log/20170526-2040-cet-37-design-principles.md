* Draft about design principle.
* I have made some paragraphs about this for my previous draft. This is made for my next deliverable.
* Draft!!!!
    * On the recent days, technology advances in every second.
    * Overall, this project is about my attempt on developing a wearable social sensor.
    * For that matter, there are a lot of development kit and programming frameworks to kick start the project.
    * However, the situation would be different when this project finishes.
    * When this project finishes, there could be a better development platform available.
    * That, or I could have just missed an available development tools those are fitter for this project.
* Draft for next paragraph!!!!
    * My design principle is to have everything as portable as possible when I am not sure on what will be the hurdles later on.
    * "Portability" refers to codes and electronics schematics that can be deployed in most development environment with little to change necessary.
    * Generally, for this project, this implies to choose a generally available development board for electronics as well as to use its accompanying programming language.
* Next paragraph draft!!!!
    * The ideal development board for this project will be a "liberal", programming language agnostic development kit.
    * The chosen board need to have a generous options for connectivity, decent amount of input and outputs pins, and will be better to have several supported programming language to be programmed with.
* Draft again :D.
    * The ideal programming language will be a programming language that is not strictly typed but also not too liberal. Since, I am the only developer for this project, if I expect for people to continue the project in the future, the codes must be cleanly typed, readable, and well structured. A liberal programming language with emphasize on flexible coding like JavaScript will not satisfy this requirement. This project needs to use a programming language that can enforce a good writing style to any programmers regardless their skills.
* Next paragraph is about my choice of database.
    * This project will use a hosted database service to store data. However, since I personally is not keen on database and its practices. The chosen database might not be specifically the best solution, but the most accessible for me to develop. This also means to have whichever database supported by a programming language from the chosen development board.
* Paragraph on what makes this project is different than other lifelogging/real-life social data gathering project.
    * From the previous chapter __*(please put reference to State of the Art chapter here)*__, there are no implementation that involves on real-time data gathering. Most of data are gathered seamlessly but the storing process is still done manually. It would be a good test for this project to implement real-life, real-time data gathering.
* This is paragraph related to my technologies of choice.
* To sum up, the choose of technologies will mainly revolve the development board. Nowadays, programming language can be compiled and wrapped into another programming language. An electronics development boards have options to be programmed in another programming language. Most of the time, electronics development kit comes in a specific framework for a programming language, unless there is a community needs on wrapping that framework into another programming language. This suggest on the availabilities for common development platforms like Arduino and RaspberryPI to be programmed in more than one programming languages. For this project, I will determine a programming language that well structured and enforce good writing. Then, I check if the aforementioned programming language supported with the development platform. If not, this project will use the first party framework from a programming language of which the development board designed to be developed with in the first place.ed with in the first place.
