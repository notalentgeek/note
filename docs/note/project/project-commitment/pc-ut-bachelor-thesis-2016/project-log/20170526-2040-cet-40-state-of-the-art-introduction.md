* Conclusion.
* Okay let us start!
* For introduction there will be general information about State Of The Art.
* Pointer questions.
    * What is State Of The Art?
    * What can the readers expect from State Of The Art?
    * Perhaps structure?
        * Scope.
        * What are there?
        * What can be used?
        * What are the user group?
    * Pointer to the table.
* Draft.
    * By looking from the previous to recent implementation we can define what are the possibilities.
    * In this chapter will be about State Of The Art.
    * State Of The Art is a chapter where we discuss implementations or similar things from the past until recent.
    * Although, from Google itself State Of The Art mentioned as a chapter that specifically look into past into recent implementation.
    * So, here I need a strong opening sentence that does not mention the State Of The Art itself. How can I do this?
    * Check for example of opening sentence in Google.
    * Perhaps I could use quotation.
    * I think I could refer back to what is the goal of this project in general.
    * This project aims to make an easy to make solution for social data gathering.
    * __Establishing a project without looking previous thing that have been done is not the best solution.__
    * __To begin a project without looking previous same things those have already been done is not the best solution.__
    * I like where this sentence is going. However, I do not like the "the previous same things".
    * I need a word to describe that doing a project without learning the previously similar project those have been done is not a great idea.
    * To begin a project.
    * Without looking from the previous ....
    * It is better to look for inspiration.
    * Establishing a concise project without looking for inspirations is ....
    * __To establish a concise project, one needs to look for inspirations.__
    * This project aims to create "test the water" solution for social data gathering.
    * There are many parts those can be looked into, thus the parameters can go infinitely into many aspects.
    * _This project set Sociometric Badge as the primary benchmark._
    * _Sociometric Badge is a tool to capture real - life social signal._
    * I want to say that we need to look for semantic approach to determine which inspiration to look.
    * Hence, this project needs to limit itself when searching for inspirations.
    * To limit the no - ending parameters, this project needs to set a benchmark.
    * For this project, the benchmark is set to be the Sociometric Badge.
* I think that is enough for the first paragraph.
    * To establish a concise project, one needs to look for inspirations.
    * This project aims to create "test the water" approach for real - life social data gathering.
    * There are many ideas of social data gathering those can be looked into, thus the parameters can go up infinitely.
    * To just start, one usually go to brainstorm any possible ideas without limitation.
    * However, to keep everything under control, limitations are necessary and benchmark point need to be set.
    * _Before any formality, this project started with looking into the Humanyze's Sociometric Badge._
    * Since every thought had gone in and out from the Humanyze's Sociometric Badge even before any formalities happened, I set the badge as the main reference point for this project.
* To establish a concise project, one needs to look for inspirations. This project aims to create "test the water" approach for real - life social data gathering. There are many ideas of social data gathering those can be looked into, thus the parameters can go up infinitely. However, to keep everything under control, limitations are necessary and benchmark point need to be set. Since every thought had gone in and out from the Humanyze's Sociometric Badge even before any formalities happened, I set the badge as the main reference point for this project.
* I want the next paragraph(s) to define what this project is looking for. Perhaps, accessing every possible terms semantically.
* Prototype.
    * Sociometric Badge is a wearable set of sensors to detect and process social signals.
    * Semantically, Sociometric Badge is a wearable badge - like device to detect and process incoming social signal.
    * However, nowadays the term of social signal is anything refer to activities from Internet social networking (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), whereas Sociometric Badge meant for real - life social signal.
    * The flow is to get real - life social data from the continuous world and process it with computer to make sense of the data received.
    * This means the obvious needs of sensors.
    * Furthermore, as suggested by Carthal Gurrin in __*(please put reference here to the general paper about lifelogging)*__, social data needs to be taken ambiently to preserve its naturality.
    * Hence, for this project to make an alternative to Sociometric Badge, form is matter.
    * And by defining Sociometric Badge as a wearable technology, any related devices need to work as independently as possible or to have at least a form of wireless communication.
    * Internally, there are three qualities those need to be looked into when looking for related devices to Sociometric Badge: the sensor, the form, and either the independence or the form of wireless communication.
* I had these sentences before, but I think I will separate these into another paragraph.
    * As from my side, personally, I will look into inspirations that I can learn from.
    * To deduct myself what are the proper things to do for this project, the availability of documentations are good to have although not necessary.
    * It is hard to get internal information for commercial device, hence based on the availability of informations I give three classifications based on the device's project type: commercial, do it yourself, and research.
    * Sadly, it is hard to get internal information for commercial device.
    * However, despite how hard it is to get internal information for commercial devices, each of them is happened to be a shipshape and an appropriate product.
    * On the other side of the spectrum, there are many do it yourself electronics badges that usually focused on their easiness to be made and modified.
    * Both areas could be exists within a specific research that had previously done.
    * Hence, based on the availability of informations I give three classifications based on the device's project type: commercial, do it yourself, and research.
    * And for the kind of informations, I will look for any documentations those are made by each first parties of each respective inspirational devices.
* Both paragraphs.
    * Semantically, Sociometric Badge is a wearable badge - like device to detect and process incoming social signal. The problem is that nowadays the term of "social signal" mislead into anything that refer to activities in Internet social networking (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), whereas Sociometric Badge is meant for real - life social activities. The flow is to get real - life social data from the continuous world and process it with computer to make sense of the data received. This means the obvious needs of sensors, specifically sensors to take real-life social data. Furthermore, as suggested by Carthal Gurrin in __*(insert book name, author name, page, APA, MLA, ... here)*__, social data needs to be taken ambiently to preserve its naturality. Thus, for this project to make an alternative to Sociometric Badge, the form is matter and it should not be intrusive to be worn and to be seen. And by defining Sociometric Badge as a wearable technology, any related devices need to work as independently as possible or to have at least a form of wireless communication. Internally there are three qualities those need to be looked into when looking for related inspirational devices to Sociometric Badge: the sensor, the physical form, and either the independence of the device or the form of wireless communication.
* As from my side, personally, I will look into inspirations those I can learn from. To deduct by myself what are the proper things to do for this project, although are not necessary, the availability of documentations are good to have. Sadly, it is hard to get internal information for commercial devices. However, despite how hard it is to get internal informations for commercial devices, each of them is happened to be a shipshape and an appropriate product to learn from. On the other side of the spectrum, there are many do it yourself (DIY) electronics badge projects those are usually focused on their easiness to be made and modified. These DIY projects fit with this project low - risk, small commitment principles. Both spectrum could exists within a specific research that had previously been done. So, based on the availability of informations I give three classifications based on the device's project type: commercial, do it yourself, and research. And for the kind of informations, I will look for any documentations those are made by each first parties of every respective inspirational devices, these usually related to source codes and schematics.ective inspirational devices, these usually related to source codes and schematics.
