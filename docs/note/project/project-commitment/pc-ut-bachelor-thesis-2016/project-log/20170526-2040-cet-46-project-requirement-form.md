* This is my note about form requirements.
    * Form is matter however, since I have no particular knowledge to make a good design. I took an approach to make a simple orthodox design with focus to fit all hardware components into smallest form possible.
    * The ideal form is similar to what already achieved by Memoto/Narrative Clip, a compact 3.6 cm x 3.6 cm x 0.9 cm formed device.
    * However, this is not idea for development purposes.
    * The minimal form requirements is to create a form with some additional spaces for wires and in case of miscalculations.
* The realistic form requirement is to create a form that is perfect fit for any hardware used to make the physical client.l client.
