* I want to have an array of captured QR codes for display purposes.
* The 1st data is the string itself.
* The 2nd data is the countdown.
* I think the countdown should be for like 5 minutes?
* I am not sure on how long, in average, a face to face conversation would happen. So my guess is 5 minutes.
* This is to cover the limitation of qr detection that is unable to detect multiple QR codes at the same time.
* 5 minutes is equal to 300.000 milliseconds.conds.
