* This is a chapter about introduction.
* I think this chapter is more about making introductory paragraph within a chapter.
* Which is exactly what I need! I have been stuck making introduction since the long time.
* Actually somewhere within this course, it states that you should not write your introduction in the first place.
    * Perhaps, write your introduction paragraph after you have done everything.
    * But make sure to write introduction paragraph just before the conclusion.
* As it is everything in writing, introduction paragraph has requirements.
    * Need to mention back the thesis statement again.
        * This is not mandatory.
        * But try to make your readers remember what is the goal of this project again.
    * Paragraph has one topic sentence.
        * This is the main idea of the paragraph.
        * Only one topic sentence per - paragraph.
        * Usually, located in beginning or in the end of each paragraph.
* Here are some examples.
    * Begin the paragraph with contradiction.
    * Direct quotation.
    * Fact (interesting fact).
    * Give an illustration as an opening paragraph.
        * This could be useful in more descriptive chapter.
        * Like State Of The Art.
    * Make a provoking statement.
    * Open with general statement, then narrow it directly into more specific statement.
* The main idea of introduction paragraph are these.
    * Get the reader attention.
    * Introduction to the overall main idea of the chapter.
