* The homepage of Microsoft SenseCam here, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sensecam/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sensecam/) refers to 2 web pages.
    * [http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~cgurrin/index.html](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~cgurrin/index.html), the first web page is the personal bio of the researcher.
    * [http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/11/cathal-gurrin-life-logger](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/11/cathal-gurrin-life-logger), the second web page is a dead link with Flash based video from Economist.com.
* Here are my summarization for both web pages.
