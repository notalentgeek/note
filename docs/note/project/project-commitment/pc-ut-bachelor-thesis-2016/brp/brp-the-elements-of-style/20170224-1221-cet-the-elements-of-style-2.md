* The key here is how to make easy flowing documents.
* English writing that is easy to follow and to be comprehended with decent level of English.
* "Write in a way that comes naturally".
* Try to not explain too much.
* Do not join independent clauses with comma.
* Please omit needlessly words!
* I think the key here is to make all sentences as independent as possible.
* There is restrictive and non - restrictive sentence.
	* The restrictive sentence is a sentence that is come without sub clauses.
	* The non - restrictive sentence is a sentence that is come with sub clauses.
* Here are some examples of restrictive and non - restrictive sentence.
	* Restrictive sentence, "My cousin Bob is a talented harpist.".
	* Non - restrictive sentence, "Our oldest daughter, Mary, sings".
		* The sub clauses here is, "Mary".
		* Whereas the main clauses here is, "Our oldest daughter sings."
* When there is a sub clauses, separate it with a comma.
* Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.
* So the pattern is like this, "[sub clause], [conjunction] [independent clause].".
* When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once, a comma is useful when the connective sentence it "but".
* So for above point do not use comma if the subjects for both clauses are the same and is not using "but".
* What is gerunds?
