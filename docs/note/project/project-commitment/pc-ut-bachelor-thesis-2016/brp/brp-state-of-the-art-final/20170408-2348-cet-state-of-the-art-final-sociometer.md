Arbitrary information     :

* Sociometer able to detect face - to - face communication.
* Sociometer does not have a proximity sensor, instead it uses a low powered infrared presence detection to make sure only short ranged presence is detected (to detect only conversation between the wearers).
* Sociometer face - to - face detection with infrared.
* Sociometer has microphone to capture the feature of incoming audio.
* Sociometer has motion sensor from accelerometer.
* Sociometer is the earliest prototype into the upcoming Sociometric Badge.
