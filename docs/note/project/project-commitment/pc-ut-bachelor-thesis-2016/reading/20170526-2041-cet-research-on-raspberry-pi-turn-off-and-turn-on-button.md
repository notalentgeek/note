* Raspberry PI Solution for power on and power off.
* The key here is to have simple turn off and turn on solution to make my Raspberry PI as portable as possible.
* As far as I know there are 2 kinds of turn off in Raspberry PI. The full turn off and then low power turn off.
    * The full turn off is like to shutdown the operating system and then plugged out the power cable.
    * The low power turn off is like to sleep (I think?) the operating system while keep the power cable plugged in.
* I found some Raspberry PI modules (all of these are very expensive, more expensive than the Raspberry PI itself!) that can be just bought and use. Some comments on my Reddit thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/66ojpl/need_solution_for_power_off_and_power_on_for_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/66ojpl/need_solution_for_power_off_and_power_on_for_my/) mentioned that these modules are meant for full turn - off.
