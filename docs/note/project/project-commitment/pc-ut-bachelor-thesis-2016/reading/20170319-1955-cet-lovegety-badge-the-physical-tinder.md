* Lovegety, "physical Tinder" badge.
* There was this electronics badge that was used as a matchmaking tools in Japan.
* There were 3 preferences that you can pick to identify what you want from your potential match. These preferences are these.
	* "Let's just chat.".
	* "Let's go sing some karaoke.".
	* "Get2".
* I think the last one is for sex? I am not sure, if Asian people is into this kind of random "meet and sex" stuffs.
* From the Wikipedia page of Lovegety here, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovegety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovegety), "Get2" mode is inferred as a "looking for love" mode.
* It could means, "looking for girlfriend" as well.
* It works just similar to Tinder, you set your preference, walk, if there is opposite gender that also has the same preference the Lovegety badge will start to notify its wearer.
	* I am thinking on how this badge would notify its wearer. Probably using small vibration motor or beeping sound.
	* But, in densely populated area like Tokyo beeping sound could not be easily heard.
* There is this article from Yahoo as well (I took this article from the Internet way back machine), [http://web.archive.org/web/20091027114257/http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Bunker/5921/lovegety.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20091027114257/http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Bunker/5921/lovegety.html).

* The detection range for this badge is 15 feet so it is around 5 meters (4.572 meters to be exact).
* The badge is priced around 21 US Dollars. Which in my opinion will be quite expensive to buy nowadays, since you can have everything infinitely small and cheaper as a smartphone application anyway.
