* For my project I need to detect QR codes in real time.
* Although, at basic, detecting 1 Qr code is enough, having to be able to detect multiple QR codes is the ideal result I would like to have.
* From this StackOverflow discussion, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15107610/how-to-read-multiple-qr-codes-from-one-image-using-zxing-library](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15107610/how-to-read-multiple-qr-codes-from-one-image-using-zxing-library). It seems that there is a way to achieve multi - QR codes detection.
