* What does `using namespace` means?
    * I found the answer in this link, [http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/49748/](http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/49748/).
    * Usually `using namespace` is used for `using namespace std;`. `std` is the standard library for C++. `std` has the basic operation like `cout`, `cin`, ....
    * However, if we are using multiple libraries there could be multiple functions with same name.
    * Let say library `std` and `dummy`, each, has a function called `dummy_function()`. Without `using namespace std;` means there are two definitions of `dummy_function()`. Usually without `using namespace std` the proper function call will be `std::dummy_function()` or `dummy::dummy_function()`.
    * `using namespace std;` means to always use function from `std` library if there are duplicate names. This means with only writing `dummy_function()` the compiler will always take `dummy_function()` from `std` instead of `dummy`.
* Below is the screenshot from the discussion about `using namespace std;` means.

* What does `return 0;` means?
    * The `0` refer to the error value.
    * The `int` in `int main()` is because in the main runtime C++ codes return an integer or error codes.
    * This is very useful when executing multiple commands in terminal.
* What is the different between /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib?
    * /usr/lib is used for library installed by operating system.
    * /usr/local/lib is used for library compiled and then installed by operating system.
* Every `class` declaration in C++ followed with semi - colon.
* What is `namespace`?
    * `namespace` is a declarative region that provide scope to identifier.
    * I got the information from this link, [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5cb46ksf.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5cb46ksf.aspx).
* There were often mistakes, I wrote this codes `g++ -o -v output_file main.cpp`. Whereas the correct compilation codes is like this, `g++ -o output_file -v main.cpp`.
    * Make sure to put appropriate arguments for each parameters! In this case `-o` should always be followed with the name of the output file.
* There is this term called "function prototype". After searching, it is actually a normal function but without the content. Prototype function only mentions what are the inputs and what is the output.
* In C/C++ usually semicolon ";" is put in the end of the function declaration.
* Access specifiers are a notion on the accessibilities of a function or variable. The most common access specifiers are public, private, and protected.
    * Public functions or variables can be accessed from anywhere within the same program.
    * Private functions or variables can be accessed within same class or a friend functions.
* What is friend function? Friend function is a function that can access property of other private function. There are two kinds of friend function.
    * Globally defined friend function.
    * Bidirectional friend function.
* I have a question about why inheritance is always followed by public statement. This is the example.

```markdown
class foo;
class bar:public foo;
```

* The `public` namespace is the most common use.
* The `private` and `protected` access specifiers can be used as well, but only in very specific case.
* I found below image in this webpage, [http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/private_inheritance.php](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/private_inheritance.php).

* Basically private variable in parent cannot be inherited unless it is a friend function or variable.
* For publicly inherited class the public and protected function and variable are keep into their respective access specifier in the sub - class.
* For private  inherited class the public and protected function and variable are converted into private in the sub - class.
* For protected inherited class the public and protected function and variable are converted into protected in the sub - class.
* This is the screenshot of the article.

* Function prototype is like a strict blueprint that need to be followed. Here is an example of function prototype.

```markdown
void test_prototype_function(int _i);
```

* The strict is to ensure that when the function is created it needs to follow that the specification provided from the function's blueprint.
* Usually blueprints is placed in a header file.
* So, header file .h is used to provide blueprints while the .cpp is used to provide definitions and implementations part.
* I was wondering what part of codes should be in header file and which part of codes should be in the .cpp file. I found this .pdf with quite explanations.

[./20170807-1503-cet-1-7.pdf](./20170807-1503-cet-1-7.pdf)

* Some that I understand from the .pdf.
    * In header file there need to be a safety guard. Examples of safety guards are `#pragma once` and `#ifndef` followed with `#define`, the content of the library, and then `#endif`.
    * The declarations! Everything that has value and take space in runtime or static does not belong to the header file.
    * Set up global variable that can be used for the entire program to be declared with, for example, `extern int sample_integer`. Then later in the .cpp file define that variable with, for example, `int sample_integer = 0;`. I think `extern` is only for C and not C++ in particular.
    * Every .h file should include every other library dependencies.
    * There is this example about using `struct`. Basically if I need to create incomplete/forward declaration. Then keep declare the same `struct` later as a normal variable. The thing here is to have incomplete/forward declaration first before use it later in the same header .h file.
* Based from a discussion here, [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/167723/what-should-and-what-shouldnt-be-in-a-header-file](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/167723/what-should-and-what-shouldnt-be-in-a-header-file). Every statements that generates data and code as they parsed does not belong in the header (.h) file.

* `protected` access specifier is a little bit weird because it prevent the class itself to access the protected functions or variables. However, `protected` allows the functions or variables to be accessed in the children/inherited classes.
* Reference for protected class, is in this link, [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e761de5s.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e761de5s.aspx).
* In my own example, protected class is like when I have a class named `human` and it inherits into `arm`, `body`, `head`, `leg`, .... The body has a `protected` function called `reduce_hit_point()` but can only be accessed from the children classes. Hence, this way there is no way the HP (hit point) reduced from the `human` class but the children classes.
* `virtual` is a member function that let the children classes to override/polymorph a function (or variables).
* If `virtual` is not used the function is not polymorphed despite there is a same name function in the child class (the original function from parent is the one who still be called).
* Here is a documentation about `virtual`, [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0y01k918.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0y01k918.aspx).
* When to use `float` and when to use `double`?
    * In many cases C++ developer would use `double` over `float`.
    * `float` only be used when dealing with a thousands of `float` values without concern on accuracy.
* A discussion here, [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/188721/when-do-you-use-float-and-when-do-you-use-double](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/188721/when-do-you-use-float-and-when-do-you-use-double), mentioned that "If you have an input of 100,000 numbers from a file or a stream and need to sort them, put the numbers in a `float[]`."
* Here is the screenshot of the discussion.

};

class client_1 {
    problem p;
    attorney::hello_1(p); // Error.
    attorney::hello_2(p); // Error.

[./20170807-1503-cet-1-15.png](./20170807-1503-cet-1-15.png)

* In the nutshell.
    * `public` means the everything program - wide can access the function or the variable.
    * `private` means only the class object can access the function or the variable.
    * `protected` means only the children or friend class can access the function or the variable (the class object itself cannot access protected variable).

* There is no difference on friend declaration, as long it is clearly stated which class friend to which class.
* There is global friend function/variable and then there is local friend function/variable as well.
* Here is an example to declare the whole class as a friend function.

```markdown
friend class friend_class;
```

* Here is an example of global friend function.

```markdown
friend void print_width (box _b);
```

* Here are my example codes for friend function/variable.

```markdown
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Prototype. Usually in box.h.
class box {
private:
    double width;
public:
    friend void print_width (box _b);
    void set_width (double _w);
};

// Function definition usually in box.cpp.
void box::set_width (double _w) {
    /* `width` can be accessed because this function accessed after `box`
    object */
    width = _w;
}

// "Global" function accessing `box` due to `friend` function.
void print_width (box _b) {
    // This function can access private variable of `box`.
    cout << "width: " << _b.width << endl;
}

// Main function for the program.
int main () {
    box b;
    // Set box width with member function.
    b.set_width(10.0);
    // Use friend function to print the width.
    print_width(b);

    return 0;
}
```

* Use `typedef` to create an alias of type data or to group type data together.
* There is `template` as well but I am not sure what is the use of it.
* Some documentations about `typedef` and `template` can be followed in here, [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typedef](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typedef) and here [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias).
* `static` function and variable is used if you want to have class - wide global function and variable. So all class with the same name or children can access the "global" function/variable that is that `static` function/variable.
* I can just declare a global variable without a class encapsulate it.
