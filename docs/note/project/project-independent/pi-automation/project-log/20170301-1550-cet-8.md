* Jinja2 templating tutorial.
* The tutorial can be found here, [https://realpython.com/blog/python/primer-on-jinja-templating/](https://realpython.com/blog/python/primer-on-jinja-templating/).
* Flask is using Jinja2 as its templating engine.
* The cool thing about Jinja2 is that it is using .html extension.
* The command to install Jinja2 is `sudo pip3 install jinja2` or if in virtual environment the command will be `pip3 install jinja2`.
* Anyway, if you install Flask from `pip` it would also install Jinja2 automatically.
* Jinja2 is part of `from flask import render_template`.
* You can put any arbitrary variables in the HTML template using `render_template()` function. This is an example.

```markdown
@app.route("/")
def index():
    render_template(
        "which_template_you_want_to_use.html",
        any_variable_1="any_value_although_it_is_usually_string",
        any_variable_2="any_value_although_it_is_usually_string",
        any_variable_3="any_value_although_it_is_usually_string",
        any_variable_4="any_value_although_it_is_usually_string",
        any_variable_5="any_value_although_it_is_usually_string"
    )
```

* Then these variables can be called in the template `"which_template_you_want_to_use.html"` with `{{any_variable_1}}`.
* This is an example specifically for Flask.
* There is template inheritance as well.
    * The sub - template is what usually the main display as it is the same case with `which_template_you_want_to_use.html`.
    * The super template is the main template (the larger HTML files with all CSS and JS files attached into it) that will be added with functionalities from the sub - template.
* So in analogous, super template is the function and the sub - template is the arguments.
* But needed to be known that argument can be a function as well.
* Hence, this can be further dumbed down into several sub - template.
* There is block tag like this, `{% block %}` this is meant for the sub - template to fill and for super template to reference which part of it got filled by child template.
* Example `{% block %}` in sub - template.

```markdown
{% block this_from_sub_template %}
  {# Put some HTML or Jinja2 codes here. #}
{% endblock %}
```

* Example `{% block %}` in super template.

```markdown
{% block this_from_sub_template %}
{% endblock %}
```

* In super template we just do not fill anything in between of the Jinja2 tag.
* Do not forget to put `{% extends "the_super_template.html" %}` in the uppermost of the sub - template.
* If you need to render a block from super template then use this `{{super()}}`. This is the example codes.

```markdown
{# These codes are in sub - function. #}
{% block footer %}
    {# These codes will take `footer` block from whatever this template     extends from. #}
  {{super()}}
{% endblock %}
```

* There is macros as well in Jinja2.
* Macros is like a function but for the templating engine.
* Here is an example of macros in Jinja2.

* Here is an example of using built - in filter as well as to make custom filter.

* Here is all kind of expression that can be used within Jinja2.
