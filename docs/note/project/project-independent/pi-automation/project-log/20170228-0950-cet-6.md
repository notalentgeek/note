* What do I need is that I need to have my portfolio in the GitHub pages.
* So, I need to prototype and then unit tested everything that is related to walk.
* The last codes I got from Reddit are these codese.

```markdown
import os
result = [dirpath for dirpath, dirnames, _ in os.walk("/home/notalentgeek/Dropbox/notalentgeek/notalentgeek-wiki") if not dirnames]
for r in result: print(r)
```

* What does Python's `os.walk()` do?
    * So the `os.walk()` will return a tuple of directory, folder, and then files.
    * And this is will be done recursively.
    * So let say `(diretory, folders, files)` as `(x, y, z)`.
    * The `y` will look into `x` for any possible folders.
    * The `z` will look into `x` for any possible files.
* So for my project goal to automate my .md notes. I need to search on the deepest level of `x` that has no element on `y` as `xnote`.
* Then I took one level up of `xnote` as `xnoteup`.
* Then for every `z`.
    * I took join path of `xnote` and `z` as `xnotefile = os.path.join(xnote, z)`.
    * I took join path of `xnoteup` and `z` as `xnoteupfile = os.path.join(xnoteup, z)`.
    * I move from `xnotefile` into `xnoteupfile`.
* I think problem solved here.
