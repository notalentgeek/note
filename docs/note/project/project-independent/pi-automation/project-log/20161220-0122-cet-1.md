* There is this `else:` statement that can be used after any loop (`for`, `while`, ...) statement. This `else:` statement will be executed after the loop ends (for example, when the condition does meet anymore).

    * Example codes.

```markdown
if [1]:
    print("Then")
else:
    print("Else")
for x in [1]:
    print("Then")
else:

* `os.path.normcase` is used to remove any unwanted properties and symbol from a path string. Hence, the string can be treated as a path.
* Documentation on `os.listdir()`, [https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.listdir](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.listdir).
* `os.listdir()` is used to return an array of all available files in path of this method's argument.

    * `os.remove()` used to remove a file.
    * `os.rmdir()` used to remove an empty directory.
    * `shutil.rmtree()` used to delete a directory and all its contents.
* Some Python commands to know if a path lead to a folder or a file, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3204782/how-to-check-if-a-file-is-a-directory-or-regular-file-in-python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3204782/how-to-check-if-a-file-is-a-directory-or-regular-file-in-python).
    * `os.path.isdir("bob")` for checking directory/folder.
    * `os.path.isfile("bob.txt")` for checking file (other than directory).

* Python code to copy file or folder using `shutil` library, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123198/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123198/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-python).

```markdown
import shutil
# Both with or without the file extension works.
shutil.copy2('/dir/file.ext', '/new/dir/newname.ext')
shutil.copy2('/dir/file.ext', '/new/dir')
```

* Python codes to rename a file using `os` library. This does not working for moving file from internal storage into external storage in Unix based operating system. For that, use `shutil.move()` instead, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2491222/how-to-rename-a-file-using-python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2491222/how-to-rename-a-file-using-python).
    * Example code, `os.rename("old.txt", "new.md")` those arguments can be an absolute path as well.
* Python codes to rename a file using `shutil` library. This method works in both Unix and Windows operating system, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2491222/how-to-rename-a-file-using-python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2491222/how-to-rename-a-file-using-python).
    * The codes can be used to cut/move file as well. The argument can be an absolute path to the directory/file.

```markdown
import shutil
shutil.move("old.txt", "new.md")
```

* How to create a folder using Python, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273192/how-to-check-if-a-directory-exists-and-create-it-if-necessary](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273192/how-to-check-if-a-directory-exists-and-create-it-if-necessary).

```markdown
if not os.path.exists(directory): # Check first if the folder is exists.
    os.makedirs(directory)
```

* The `directory` could be just the name of the directory/folder you want to make or an absolute path.
    * The first is means that the folder will be made in the directory of which the Python script runs.
    * The latter is to create directory/folder in any other location within your computer.
