* How to classify folder.
* So there are two folders that concern me.
* The first folder is a folder that full of images, memes, wallpapers, and stupid stuffs.
* The second folder is a folder that is filled with movie, diagram, ....
* Both folders have images and videos (or animation).
* And I think .gif sit within both images and videos.
* So, how can I classify these folders?
	* The first one contains memory.
	* The second one contains knowledge.
	* The first one contains things that you see.
	* The second one contains thins that you watch and try to understand.
* I know for sure that naming these folders into "see" and "understand" is probably the stupid things ever.
* How about "media" for the first folder?
	* No, the second folder could be classified as a media as well.
	* Or just get both together?
	* And then classify that based on the the content?
		* So, there would be one big folder of media.
		* And then keep sub - ing the file based on the context.
* I think that would be the best solution for now..
