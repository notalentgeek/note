* Simple trick on how to make image attached in HTML file to be responsive.
* The first thing is to set either or both `height:100%;` and `width:100%;`.
* The codes above are already set the images to be responsive of page's view port (wbe browser's UI dimension).
* Adding `max-height:xxxpx` or `max-width:xxxpx` would be better since this CSS prevent images to be drawn overly big.
* I get this reference from this StackOverflow discussion, [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15458650/make-an-image-responsive-simplest-way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15458650/make-an-image-responsive-simplest-way).
