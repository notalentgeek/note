* This is a basic Palicoes/Prowler Mode tutorial, [http://www.gamerguides.com/monster-hunter-generations/your-palico-companions/prowler-mode](http://www.gamerguides.com/monster-hunter-generations/your-palico-companions/prowler-mode).
* Prowler Mode is a new features in Monster Hunter Generations where you play as a Palicoe (Felynx or Melynx).
* The mechanics are different, as such in Prowler Mode player cannot use item.
* Palicoes will depends solely on the skills.
* What I am missing is how to get and build the ideal Palicoes to farm, to be played battle in Prowler Mode, or as a companion.
* I have not read this tutorial but I hope this tutorial is helpful.
