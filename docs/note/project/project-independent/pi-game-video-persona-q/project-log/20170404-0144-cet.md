* I have finished the game.
* Cleared the last quest to kill The Reaper F.O.E.
* Cleared the final quest to attain Zeus.
* After the quest, it is said in the Velvet Room that I am supposed to be able to fuse Zeus.
* However, there is no option to fuse him.
* After I looked up here, [https://www.gamefaqs.com/3ds/739685-persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth/faqs/70858#section59](https://www.gamefaqs.com/3ds/739685-persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth/faqs/70858#section59). The Warrior Zeus Persona is on level 87.
* The Zeus itself is on level 91.
* I need to fuse Warrior Zeus first before fusing Zeus.
