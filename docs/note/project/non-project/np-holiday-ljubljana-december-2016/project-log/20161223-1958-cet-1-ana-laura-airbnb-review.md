* My review for Ana, our AirBNB host while staying in Ljubljana.

TLDR, the best accommodation for the price you can get in Ljubljana.

The pros are these.
* Ana is pretty flexible and easy to cooperate. Two weeks prior arriving, we had changed in our flight (got delayed by a day because my stupid mistake) and Ana altered our reservation.
* Simple route, easy to access, and easy to remember. Go out from this house, turn right in the big road, and walking ~15 minutes will get you into the city center.
* The accommodation is well designed and look cozy. It looks what it is on the photos.
* The price!
* There is a kitchen. Usually with this price you would not get something like this. Nevertheless, when we live there, we did not use the kitchen.

The cons are these.
* Lack of heaters, there are main heater and two portable heaters, but for us that was enough. We tricked this by having additional blankets.
* The hot water need to "charged". So sometimes there is no or little hot water. However, in our last day we had no problem with hot water after the previous night Ana told me this information.

My score is 4/5, would give 5/5 if there is no heater problem.
Am I recommending this? Yes for sure!
