            "text": "When I was kid I always dreamed to go off my comfort zone and be the best Pokemon trainer out there. It was in early 2004, my father gave me a GameBoy Advance (GBA). It was my first ever electronics device I grew attachment into. Later in the same year, summer 2004, I went to a wholesale center with my grandmother. The building was bridged in such ways it connects to the building in the opposite of the road. That building is still the biggest consumer electronics market in Jakarta, the city I lived. Since I used to bring my GBA anywhere I go, my grandmother told me that I could pick a new video game. I bought the best video game I have ever played that day, Pokemon Crystal.\n\n\n\n\nUnknown to her, this event set my life goals to go away of conveniences and start to build my \"Pokemon\" roster. I want to set my self to build and make competitive products that people use and like. I then took study in Creative Technology at UT, because their orientation in less theory and more into making stuffs happen.\n\n\nIn my teenage years, I brought my laptop anywhere I go to codes anytime, everywhere I want. I started my programming with Pascal, but there was not much attention I gave into. Up until when ActionScript was getting popular and programming became more visual than ASCII diamonds displayed in terminal, I started to spent my time trying to program myself video games. I started my likes of open source framework with Flixel. It was an arcade video game framework based on Adobe's open sourced Flex.\n\n\nI learned and touched resistor at the first time in my first year of Creative Technology. The program started with students learning how to use Arduino. I feel the lower entry point given from Arduino is what enabled me into electronics development. I have been using Arduino and its variant for my projects since my first year in Creative Technology. Nowadays, I like the flexibility to code and test first in Linux before setup the electronics with single board computer (SBC) like Raspberry PI.\n\n\nIn the end, I want to make rosters of products that enable society to achieve good things in their life.\n\n\nthis website...\n\n\nThis website I made as a replacement of Evernote. Here I put every public notes I made. Notes are all written Markdown format, a lightweight markup language. I moved from Evernote because there is no support for Linux client, whereas since four years ago I do all of my works in Linux. Their solution for their Linux user is to use Evernote web client. However, the web client is buggy (specially for bullet and numbering, limitation how many image I can upload in a go, ...) and lack of features that the desktop clients have. Since then, I have tried to adjust my digital note taking habit by trying other note taking/storing applications, from the open source to the non - open source ones. In the end, I ended up storing my note as a Markdown file and showing the public notes via this website I made with MKDocs. Between MKDocs and my end, there are Python automation scripts to handle directories structuring and naming convention.\n\n\nMKDocs itself is a Python static flat - file site generator. I write all my notes in a folder with all of its attachments (.pdf files, images, and compressed directories). Then, my automation script will automatically handle the naming convention of the note (add date, time, and time zone). The directories outputted from the automation script will be the directories I put in MKDocs. Due to the nature of no - database, flat - file website, all data will not verified but rather taken directly from the folder's structure. Hence, 404 web page not found, for note that used to exists, could be because I change the note's name or I move the note into different directory.\n\n\nI have two main note directories, this one, in this website, for my public notes and a directory for all of my private note. I made this website to share my public notes, to make me (and others) easier to track my projects, and as a offline documentation when I work my codes without internet connection (I remember the hard time of using Indonesian internet to work, the availability and the speed). This website is working offline in smartphone as well. This whole website is packaged in a directory with index.html to open, no other system dependencies.\n\n\nSo far, my note taking habit helps me a lot when I am working on projects. It was hard to collaborate and share notes for projects I did with others. This system enables me to do collaboration and share notes with others. Although, the most notes are supposed only for my own benefits, I hope somehow my notes help others too.\n\n\nnote taking application and work flows...\n\n\nI started to like to take notes when I was in my second year of my senior high school. Back then there is no proper internet connection, nor I have proper computer to take digital notes. It started with the traditional pen and paper notes. I used to have an A5 looseleaf binder to hold my notes. Looseleaf binder let me adjust my notes liberally and share it to friends in case they need a copy of it.\n\n\nNear in the end of my second year, my father gave me his 12 inches Asus S6F laptop. The laptop is still working until now (2017) and is still my best experience with any laptop I have ever used. With this laptop I started to take my notes digitally. The first web service I used to store my notes was \nScribd\n. It was not a specific service for note per see, but you can store any amount of .pdf documents there. Although I am not using Scribd anymore, my high school notes has been seen ~20.000 times and I received occasional emails from teachers wanted to use my notes for their teaching materials.\n\n\n\n\nI started using Evernote when I was in my second year in UT. I used the normal, free version until I realized I need more storage. Then, I decided to subscribe to its premium features. It was all good, with 1 GB additional memory to store higher resolution images and note scans. The struggle came when I started to used Linux more religiously. There is no Evernote desktop client for Linux. The only solution is either to use GeekNote (third party Evernote client) or use Evernote web application. I have no luck on setting up the former and the Evernote web application has less features than the desktop version. Around 2014, I looked up for alternative for Evernote.\n\n\nI was keen into open source software (keep in mind I am not that strict :D, I use commercial software as well), some Evernote alternatives I had used were Laverna and Paperworks. Both were still in development. Laverna is more flexible, because you can host it or use it offline as a standalone Atom based desktop application. Whereas, Paperworks (as far as I know) is strictly to be used as a hosted web application. There was still no comfort of using both of these, I still gradually moved back using Evernote.\n\n\nAfter I used Laverna and Paperworks, I used traditional CMS like Drupal and Wordpress. Both are very good, solid, and industry staple CMSs. It was a pleasant experience when taking notes and when sharing notes to others, but it lacks the flexibility to be moved. It was not an easy job to convert, export, and import Wordpress posts into different computer or server. However, I have not yet tried Drupal setting with the portable SQLite database (SQLite seems to be the solution, because you have all your post in a single, stand - alone file).\n\n\nI found my home in \nTagSpaces\n. TagSpaces is an open source file management/tagging software. Albeit it is open source, it has some premium features that people can buy to use. Its main functionality comes as a file management with tagging. So, directory and file search can be done faster within the TagSpaces client. What drew me into TagSpaces was its file manager and the ability to make note as a single HTML or Markdown. The good part about the single HTML note is that regardless how many images attached in the HTML note, it will still be compiled into a single file. Although, the lag is apparent when HTML note with big image files is being opened.\n\n\nTagSpaces has a WebDAV version to be hosted in a server as well. With this, TagSpaces can be hosted like it is a CMS. However, I feel like the WebDAV version is not maintained (at least, the last time I saw it), with some tutorials are left dated.\n\n\nI looked up for solution and I was very excited with flat - file CMS or static - site generator. These things can generate website based on some .txt files without any server nor OS dependencies. The first thing I tried was Jekyll, Raneto, and then MKDocs. I tried Jekyll, it is made with Ruby programming language. I like it, but I have some troubles on setting up Ruby in my Linux computer (occasional installation error, when I download it from package manager). Raneto is made with NodeJS, the people's programming language :D while, MKDocs is made with Python. In the end I choose MKDocs over Raneto because it has higher stars in GitHub (~4.000 vs ~1.200) and I like Python and Jinja2 more than the template engine Raneto used.\n\n\nWith MKDocs and Python automation script I can easily maintain my notes both online (can be hosted in GitHub for free with no file exceed 50 MB, I think), offline, and offline to be viewed in smart phone as well. The two drawbacks is now my private notes and my public notes are in separate directories and slow compiling time (I have like 4.000 notes, I think that is why). But, so far I like my MKDocs setup for taking note.",

            "text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\nThis paper is some interesting facts about German language.\n\n\nGerman is an official language in 7 countries.\n\n\nThere will be at least one country that speak Germany in every continent on Earth.\n\n\nFor example in ASEAN there is Papua New Guinea.\n\n\nGerman is the most spoken mother tongue in Europe. Beating even English.\n\n\nAlso widely used in scientific paper and websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish and German share 60% of vocabulary.\n\n\nThere are East Germanic language as well.\n\n\nI think East Germanic language is just like those traditional languages in Indonesia.\n\n\nThere are Gothic and Vandalic language those share similarities with East Germanic language. Although both languages are now extinct.\n\n\nGerman has a lot of compound words.\n\n\nI think this is what makes German sounds funny at first. But in the end they just mesh some word together. There are no not compound word that has monstrous length.\n\n\nThe first book was also printed in German in 1454.\n\n\nThe Gutenberg Bible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome words.\n\n\nSome words those are slang and are altered from modern English words.\n\n\n\"Geist\" means ghost in German.\n\n\n\"Kaputt\" means broken in German. I am not sure what is the difference of having additional \"t\" in the word.\n\n\n\"Schadenfreude\", means that you are relieved of someone having a bad situation. This word has no literal translation to English or any other language. Only German (I think has this word).\n\n\n\"Joggen\" is a slang German word based from English's jogging.\n\n\n\"Gedownloadet\" is also a slang German word based from English's download.\n\n\n\"Handy\" means cellphone.\n\n\n\"Fingerspitzengefuhl\" means a feeling that is on the tip of fingernail. I am not sure what is this means. Perhaps something like \"peribahasa\" or like an implicit word to determine a feeling.\n\n\n\"Schnapsidee\" is a German exclusive word to express bad idea. \"Schnap\" means shot (as it is in drink, get drink, alcoholic beverages). So it is like an idea that you get while you are drunk.\n\n\n\"Fernweh\" is an antonym to home sick. A feeling that you want to be as far from home as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman alphabet pronunciation is more or less the same with Indonesian ones, except for several words. And it is also read as it is (well, mostly).\n\n\n\"Joghurt\" is read as it has no \"h\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Y\" is read upsilon. I do not know why.\n\n\nAnd German \"Z\" is read \"tzet\". It is like you have \"z\" and \"c\" together.\n\n\nFor example \"zwei\" will read as it has \"c\", so it sounds like \"zchwei\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDas ist die basis.\n\n\n\"Das\" is like to be of English (like \"is\" or \"are\", I think).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wilkommen\" means welcome.\n\n\n\"Ich bin Mikael.\" means \"I am Mikael.\".\n\n\n\"Und\" means \"and\".\n\n\n\"Ich heisse Mikael\" state that my name is Mikael. Although I am not sure what heisse means.\n\n\n\"Ich komme aus Indonesien.\" means \"I come from Indonesia\".\n\n\nNotice how \"Indonesia\" becomes \"Indonesien\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wie hast du?\" means \"Who are you?\".\n\n\n\"Komme\" reads as it has \"e\" in it. So it is not read as \"kom\" but \"komme\".\n\n\n\"Das ist schon.\" means \"That is good.\".\n\n\n\"Schon\" means something is nice/good.\n\n\n\"Die basis\" means \"the basic\".\n\n\nSo \"die\" is like German's article word, perhaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fur sport, ich mag Tennis spielen.\" means \"For sport, I like to play tennis.\".\n\n\nI think the \"spielen\" suffix \"en\" is like English suffix \"ing\".\n\n\nSo it is for continuous tense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ich untersicht in de jungen schule.\" means \"I studied in boys school.\".\n\n\nI am not sure if this sentence is 100% correct.\n\n\nBut German plural noun has suffix of \"en\".\n\n\nThis means if suffix \"en\" is used in verb it means continuous tense, while if it is used in noun it means plural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ich habe seit Deutsch lernen in Gymnasium\" means \"I have learnt Deutsch in high school\".\n\n\nI am not sure which part denotes past tense here.\n\n\nWhat does \"seite\" means?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ich mag programierung und electronic machen\" means \"I like to programming and making electronics.\".\n\n\nNot sure if this sentence is correct though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bitte\" is a response of \"thank you\" (\"danke\").\n\n\nIt has a meaning as a permission as well.\n\n\nSimilar to Dutch's \"alstublieft\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Deze jahre\" means \"this year\".\n\n\n\"Reisen\" means \"holiday-ing\" is like having vacation but in continuous tense. I am not sure what is the English verb lol XD.\n\n\n\"Eerste\" means \"first\".\n\n\n\"Zweimal\" means \"second\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Letzte\" means \"last\".\n\n\n\"Selbstudium ander Universitat Twente\" means \"self study under University Of Twente\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ist nicht zo goed\" means \"is not so good\".\n\n\n\"Ahnlicht\" means \"similar\".\n\n\nNumbers!\n\n\n\"Acht\" means 8.\n\n\n\"Achtzehn\" means 18.\n\n\n\"Drie\" means 3.\n\n\n\"Driezehn\" means 13.\n\n\n\"Funf\" means 5.\n\n\n\"Sieben\" means 7.\n\n\n\"Siebzehn\" means 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure what is the meaning of \"Wie habe deine kinder.\".\n\n\nBut I know it is something \"Who has a children?\".\n\n\n\"Kind\" is the singular form of \"Kinder\". As it is \"child\" and \"children\".\n\n\nSo, there are some words those have suffix \"er\" for plural.\n\n\nI think this is like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ich bin secht jahren gekkomen.\" means \"I have been 6 years since I came.\".\n\n\nI am confused on \"gekkomen\" as it is from \"komme\" but there are prefix and suffix \"ge\" and \"en\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tagen\" means \"days\".\n\n\n\"Liebt\" means \"love\".\n\n\n\"Gehen\" means \"going\".\n\n\n\"Shoppen\" means \"shopping\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not so sure what is the meaning of \"zwei tage pro woche\".\n\n\nOr probably I misheard this sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lieben\" is \"loving\".\n\n\nAlright now comes question on how to determine love as it is noun or verb.\n\n\nFor example \"I love you.\" and \"You are my love.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple sentences.\n\n\n\"Du liebt Tennis spielen.\" means \"You (are) loving to play Tennis (?).\". Not sure about continuous or simple sentence.\n\n\n\"Du arbeiten in einer Firma.\" means \"You (are) working in a firm.\". Not sure about continuous or simple sentence.\n\n\n\"Einer\" means \"one\". I am not sure about the suffix \"er\".\n\n\n\"Arbeiten\" means \"working\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of reverse sentence to yes or no question.\n\n\n\"Liebt du Tennis spielen?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Q\" is pronounced \"kwe\".\n\n\n\"J\" is pronounced \"y\".\n\n\n\"V\" is pronounce \"fao\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sohn\" means \"son\".\n\n\n\"Docther\" means \"daughter\". I am not sure about this actually, but \"docther\" is definitely a Dutch word.\n\n\n\"Sohn\" is read as it has longer \"o\". This is due to \"h\" after \"o\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A\" with umlaud read as \"ae\" with not so apparent \"a\". So \"kase\" will read \"kese\".\n\n\n\"Kase\" means \"cheese\".\n\n\n\"O\" with umlaud read as \"oe\". So \"Osterricht\" will read \"Usterricht\".\n\n\n\"U\" with umlaud read as \"Uu\" with the last \"u\" toned down significantly. So \"funf\" will read \"funf\" (lol) higher tone on \"u\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Au\" reads \"ao\".\n\n\n\"Ei\" reads \"ei\".\n\n\n\"Eu\" reads \"oi\". So \"Euro\" will read \"Oiro\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Schiwimmen\" means \"swimming\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this beta like character that pronounces like \"ss\" (double s) imagine the sound of snake hissing.",

There are these things about \"was\".\n\n\nFor some reason German is really like to use \"wo\".\n\n\nInstead of \"von was\" they said \"wovon\".\n\n\nInstead of \"mit was\" they said \"womit\".\n\n\nThere are other \"wo\" as well for \"von\", \"mit\", \"nach\", \"um\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this guide it says that all of these variants are all the same.\n\n\nExample of sentence without the translations.\n\n\nWovon hast du letzte Nacht getraumt?\n\n\nWorauf freust du dich?\n\n\nWoran denkst du?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn English \"what\"can have a lot of preposition.

These below are some example of the English sentences with the German sentence structure.\n\n\nOf what did you dream last night?\n\n\nTo what are you looking forward?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, it is translated like these in German.\n\n\nWovon hast du letzte Nacht getraumt?\n\n\nWorauf freust du dich?\n\n\nWoran denkst fu?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wer\" means \"who\".\n\n\nExamples.\n\n\n\"Wer ist dein Lieblingsschauspieler?\" means \"Who is your favorite actor?\".\n\n\n\"Wer will ein Bier?\" means \"Who wants a beer?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Worauf freust du dich?\" means \"What are you looking forward to?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whom\" translates into \"wem\" or \"wen\".\n\n\n\"Whose\" translates into \"wessen\".\n\n\nIf you want to know who did/does/is something then use \"wer\".\n\n\nWhen you are using \"wer\" always put the preposition in the front of it.\n\n\nIn English the structure is like this whom + from_or_of_or_to_or_with?\n\n\nIn German the structure is like this zu_oder_von_oder_fur_oder_mit + wem_oder_wen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Warum\" means \"why\".\n\n\nExamples.\n\n\n\"Warum lernst du Deutsch?\" means \"Why are you learning German?\".\n\n\n\"Warum hast du mich nicht angerufen?\" means \"Why did not you call me?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three synonym of \"warum\", which are these.\n\n\n\"Weshalb\".\n\n\n\"Weswegen\".\n\n\n\"Wieso\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are difference at all from all those words. So I might as well stick with \"warum\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wie\" means \"how\".\n\n\nExamples.\n\n\n\"Wie gehts dir?\" means \"How are you?\".\n\n\n\"Wie komme ich von hier zur Superstrasse?\" means \"How can I get to super street from here?\".\n\n\n\"Wie grosse bist du?\" means \"How tall are you?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples.\n\n\n\"Wie lange dauert es, Deutsch zu lernen?\" means \"How long does it takes to learn German?\".\n\n\n\"Wie viel kostet das?\" means \"How much is that?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wie\" is also a word to make a comparison.\n\n\nFor examples.\n\n\n\"Ich bin genauso gross wie du.\" means \"I am exactly as tall as you.\".\n\n\n\"Die Suppe riecht ein bisschen wie Bier.\" means \"The soup smells a little like beer.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also \"wieso\" which means \"how so\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Welche\" means \"which\".\n\n\nThis word has a lot of forms like these.\n\n\n\"Welche\".\n\n\n\"Welchem\".\n\n\n\"Welchen\".\n\n\n\"Welcher\".\n\n\n\"Welches\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe form is depending on how the subject is singular or not.\n\n\nAnd I guess also depending on whether the subject is countable or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for all \"welche\" is just fine and correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples.\n\n\n\"Welche Sprachen kannst du sprechen?\" means \"Which languages can you speak?\".\n\n\n\"Welches Bier wollen wir zuerst trinken?\" means \"Which beer should we drink first?\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Welche\"/\"welchem\"/\"welchen\"/\"welches\" can be used as well as pronoun.

So, with my example the \nlog.text\n will return \n0, Primary\n.\n\n\nHowever, since I only need the name of the selected index and not the index itself, I will just use \nxxx.selectedItem[0].data.text\n where the xxx is the variable that holds the list selector object reference.\n\n\nAnother good thing to mention is that the function \nonChange1()\n and \nonChange2()\n will be put inside a list selector as a \nonchange\n property.\n\n\nThis \nonchange\n property is a function that is called every time there is change in list selector value.\n\n\nSo, whenever the user change the list selector there will be something printed in the console.\n\n\nHere is the full screenshot of the issue in the GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn HaXe there is a low level access control.\n\n\nLow level access control is used to access variables and functions (I think) from another class without explicitly creating or referencing the existing object in the run - time.\n\n\nThe keyword here is \n@:access(ClassName.ClassFunctionName)\n and \n@:allow(ClassName.ClassFunctionName)\n.\n\n\nIn later version of HaXe if either of these keywords referencing an \nInterface\n then every low level access control also applied into any possible class that inherit/implements from that \nInterface.\n\n\nHere is the link to HaXe API documentation of low level access control, \nhttp://haxe.org/manual/lf-access-control.html\n.",

So, I need to \nimport os\n at the start of the Python codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a good idea to separate environmental settings and any other specific configuration files.\n\n\nFlask allows one to import these setting as a separate files later on if the settings is necessary.\n\n\nThere is a method \nfrom_envvar()\n that is used to enable robust configuration setup. However, I am not sure yet on how to use this. Perhaps this is useful for this project? I am not so sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOoo \nfrom_envar()\n is a method to called your pre - made environmental variables.\n\n\nFrom this example \napp.config.from_envvar('FLASKR_SETTINGS', silent=true)\n means that this Flask web application will look into \nFLASKR_SETTING\n environment variable (in Linux, \nexport FLASKR_SETTING=value_here\n) the \nsilent=true\n means that this application will not complain if the setting value is not provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically there is this function to connect the Flask web application with database.\n\n\nThis tutorial used SQLite3 for database. So I am not sure if the method to connecting to database is different to non - lite SQL.\n\n\nHere are the codes to connecting to database.\n\n\n\n\ndef connect_db():\n    rv = sqlite3.connect(app.config['DATABASE'])\n    rv.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n    return rv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are little to no description on what this codes does.\n\n\nI think the \nsqlite.connect()\n is for connecting to the database.\n\n\nThen I suggest that its first argument is the database path which is located in \napp.config['DATABASE']\n.\n\n\nWhen assigning a variable into \nsqlite3.connect()\n I assume it returns the database object itself. Hence, the variable now has access to \nrow_factory\n field.\n\n\nI am not sure on how the \nsqlite3.Row\n works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a method in Flask of where you can assign new command to be executed in terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here is the basic setup to run the Flask web application.\n\n\n\n\nexport FLASK_APP=main_entry_of_your_flask_application.py\nexport FLASK_DEBUG=1\nflask run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first line is to determine the entry point of this Flask web application.\n\n\nThe second line is to set Flask application in debug mode. Means that the application will not required to be stopped and then run again to see the changes made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \nset\n instead of \nexport\n when using Windows.\n\n\nAlso never use debugging mode for a production system. Debugging mode will allow user to execute code in server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was an example of the code working.\n\n\nThere is nothing to display on \n'/'\n because the route is not yet set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction encapsulation, I am not sure on why on the ideal case there will be only one request at the time that uses the database connection.\n\n\nWhat happen in the real time application if there are multiple request at the same time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlask provides application context and the request context.\n\n\nIn NodeJS' ExpressJS there are request and response handler. But in Flask there are the application context and the request context.\n\n\nI am not so sure if these notion from NodeJS's ExpressJS works the same with Flask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this \nflask.g\n object that can be used to store settings across sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a \nteardown_appcontext()\n decorator that will execute codes when the the application is closed in the client side. It says in this tutorial that \nteardown_appcontext()\n will be executed when a request finishes.\n\n\nWhen everything went well (the error parameter will be \nNone\n)\n\n\nAn exception happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is useful to disconnect the connection to the database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure why it is necessary to put all of these methods after \nconnect_db()\n function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is only says that this is logical to put methods for same module together.\n\n\nSo, there would be no harm to put it alphabetically I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlask is a database powered application.\n\n\nHence, we need to create schema first for every database that we are going to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelational database is the SQL variants.\n\n\nDoes this means that Flask is not intended to use with NoSQL databases like MongoDB?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic command to create schema are as follows, \nsqlite3 /tmp/flaskr.db < schema.sql\n.\n\n\nHowever, the command needs to have \nsqlite3\n CLI application to be installed.\n\n\nThere is a Flask way to generate database from schema.\n\n\nIt is also good to have in application method to build and initialize database for the application itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had this problem.\n\n\nI thought the problem lies on my Python codes.\n\n\nBut the problem actually is in my schema file.\n\n\nIt is supposed to be \nexists\n no \nexist\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsqlite3.Row\n makes the returned value looks like a Python's dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you can to refactor your project it is necessary to create new virtual environment.\n\n\nDelete the \nvenv\n folder and initiate \nvirtualenv venv\n again.\n\n\nBecause otherwise the path will stay in the old project's directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to use question marks when building SQL statement.\n\n\nOtherwise the application will be vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n\nExample codes.\n\n\n\n\ndb.execute(\n    'insert into entries (title, text) values (?, ?)',\n    [request.form['title'], request.form['text']]\n)",

Is this what Harry Seldon thought of?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the most interesting part for me.\n\n\nThe badge need to be able to detect patterns of unconscious social signals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal time feedback through mobile application.\n\n\nAggregate data is collected from the wearers. So this device is already in conform with MIT's Sandy Pentland \"New Deals On Data\" ways of dealing with privacy invasive application/gadget.\n\n\nOpportunity of improvement can be determined from group's social pattern.\n\n\nThe 3 points of \"New Deals On Data\".\n\n\nData collections is an option and informed.\n\n\nIndividuals control their own data.\n\n\nData must be aggregated (the meaning of aggregated will be explained later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal time feedback. So they have already thought about having data streamed into another media while the social activity happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate, I read in the previous article that in case you want to do social data mining, ethically you need to aggregate the data (\"New Deal On Data\"). Check this article, \nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/424104/what-big-data-needs-a-code-of-ethical-practices/\n.\n\n\nAggregate means that all data are bundle into one. More over, there would be no way to display the data per profile.\n\n\nWhat I meant here is that in case you take social data all data need to be displayed aggregately (perhaps by taking average, ...).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample applications.\n\n\nFollow The Star.\n\n\nMeeting Mediator.\n\n\nThe Presence Book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this age term \"application\" is still for both hardware and software. While, nowadays \"application\" is more for software application. While, hardware application is commonly called by gadget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was this Active Badge by Xerox PARC in 1992. Thing that kick started the usage of electronics/RFID badge nowadays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also this Vocera Communication System.\n\n\nThis is like the original Sociometric Badge but with more communication features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was this idea about having context aware mobile phone.\n\n\nMobile phone that is aware of the user social situation (available, busy, psychological states of the user, ...).\n\n\nThis mobile phone is expected to dynamically react to the environment and stream - in/out data in real time .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was this Reality Mining System.\n\n\nThe website is pretty cool and informative actually, \nhttp://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/index.html\n.\n\n\nAnd also there was a VibeFones.\n\n\nVibeFones is the socially aware mobile phone. Perhaps this is what they meant by the context aware mobile phone they mentioned several paragraph above.\n\n\nThis link refer to research paper about VibeFones, \nhttp://hd.media.mit.edu/tech-reports/TR-605.pdf\n.\n\n\nThere is also this Android application about VibeFones, \nhttps://github.com/weirdwater/VibePhone\n. However it is lack of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Reality Mining System is presented by a mobile phone base system that uses Bluetooth addresses and database of user profile to determine face to face interaction within nearby user.\n\n\nI am wondering how can you determine face to face communication by only using Bluetooth connection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVibeFones uses its user location, proximity, and tone of voice to gain sophisticated understanding of people's social lives.\n\n\nThis achieved by mining their face to face and phone interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral points below mention about sensory modules and how this badge use those sensory modules to get sociometric data.\n\n\nThere is this 3 axis xyz accelerometer to detect activity such as hand movement, nodding, sitting, and walking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure how can a sole xyz accelerometer detects hand movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is speech processing modules, but it does not record any content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending information over radio frequency.\n\n\nLocation is determined by these radio frequency components. Perhaps, using some kind like triangular calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapturing face to face conversation with IR (infrared).\n\n\nWhen each badge has a line sight of each other then it is confirmed that face to face to conversation happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth is used to interfacing the Sociometric Badge with user's cellphone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect turn taking pattern of the conversation.\n\n\nOften people does not realize if he/she is dominating the conversation, while there are other people that need to be encouraged to participate more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sociometric Badge also know if one's speech always trigger boredom and negative response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach circle indicates participant in a meeting.\n\n\nThe size of the circle indicated the speaking duration.\n\n\nArrow indicates the flow of conversation, shows who is most likely to answer an argument from another person.\n\n\nColor of the circle can indicates characteristic of the participant such as interest level or persuasiveness.\n\n\nHowever, in this case color denotes movement of the person. The darker the color is the higher the activity that the person does (perhaps the activity meant is a body activity, like hand or feet movement).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge provides with real time analysis.\n\n\nThe aggregate of the data it produces shows which speaker is the most  dominant speaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerometer can record fidgeting behavior, hence quantifying boredom level of certain conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Sociometric Badge sends data to the mobile phone for every 5 seconds.\n\n\nI am not sure why it is need to be every 5 seconds. Perhaps because at that time there are no smart phone yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, it is known that the Sociometric Badge construct a mesh network (I think) to share user movement data to each other badge.\n\n\nThen it will take average of all badge wearer to raise or lower the movement threshold.\n\n\nThe data then will be aggregated via Bluetooth to mobile phone of its wearer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display of the mobile phones will be refreshed for every 5 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this Presence Book.\n\n\nThe Presence Book is like a socially aware phone book application for mobile phone.\n\n\nIn case the person busy or available it can be told directly from Presence Book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample mock up of presence book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Presence Book movement and speech activity of a wearer determine whether this wearer is available or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet say the badge wearer has less movement and the badge wearer located on its office, he/she cold be sitting and available for face to face conversation.\n\n\nIf the badge wearer is known walking. Then he/she might be accessible through email or phone call.\n\n\nThis Presence Book use location data of the badge wearer to detect their accessibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresence Book can easily display which person might know what person.\n\n\nSo this is like the People Wiki idea that I suggested before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example called Follow The Star.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow The Star is a location aware physical visualization that uses ceiling as display.\n\n\nCeiling displays are ideal for stores and office because it does not obstructed by shelves or walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Follow The Star displays badge wearer's level of expertise on certain topic.\n\n\nThe color of green on the \"Follow Of The Star\" indicates that the target is currently available.\n\n\nThe color of red on the \"Follow Of The Star\" indicates that the target is currently occupied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest that the target that they mean here is the badge wearer.\n\n\nSo this Follow The Star installation is like the interface of the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nFollow The Star is the mobile phone equivalent from the Presence Book implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication happen one way from badge to the Follow The Star.\n\n\nWhen the star receives data it will specific light bulb turned on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge is privacy concern.\n\n\nThis is because in the actual implementation there will be a lot of social data mined out of the badge wearer.\n\n\nThis paper is limited to application of which privacy concern minimal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy concern can be reduced by reporting data anonymously.\n\n\nHowever, in the Presence Book application this is not possible due to its principle on reporting whether or not a person is available or busy.\n\n\nAnother solution is to let user has a control of her/his privacy level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main goal of the sociometry badge is to increase efficiency of organizational communication and work.",

For example, what is 1 + 1?\n\n\nRational, which mean the question can be answered (not with meta physics and things like that). For example, whether or not god is exist.\n\n\nI do not know anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress important issues and relevant.\n\n\nSo the topic should be current problem or upcoming one.\n\n\nNot necessary to discuss topic that already been done or not even important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot have been done before.

Prosodic is the study of suprasegmental characteristics of speech, like intonation, rhythm and stress, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)\n.\n\n\nIntonation.\n\n\nRhythm.\n\n\nStress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Badge developed at Olivetti Research in 1990.\n\n\nHowever, this company is not relevant anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Active Badge contains small microprocessor and infrared transmitter.\n\n\nThis badge is able to broadcast identity of the wearer and trigger things. For example these are things that can be automated.\n\n\nAutomatic door.\n\n\nAutomatic telephone call forwarding.\n\n\nComputer display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main application at that time was as an aid for telephone receptionist and mainly to track people inside a office environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there was Thinking Tags in 1996.\n\n\nThinking Tags were the first computational augmented name tags.\n\n\nThinking Tags is capable to display what things are in common when two people meet in conference or meeting.\n\n\nThis was achieved depending on how many question that these people answered that has same answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years later in 1998 there is Meme Tag.\n\n\nMeme was based in Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene book at that time.\n\n\nMeme Tag allows people to electronically share brief ideas or opinion through a rather large LCD screen.\n\n\nThis system is then evolved into nTag System.\n\n\nnTag system offers commercial solution to improve, measure, and automate meetings and events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later in 1999 there was Wearable Sensor Badge developed at Phillips Research Labs.\n\n\nThis device is able to detecting simple activities using accelerometer.\n\n\nThere there was iBadge to capture interaction with student, teacher, and common classroom object within classroom environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was SocioMeter.\n\n\nSocioMeter is a wearable sensor package designed to measure face to face interactions between people with an infrared transceiver, a microphone, and 2 accelerometer.\n\n\nThis was used to mapping a network of social interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cons is that the size of SocioMeter is big and also a bit heavy for common wearable devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was UbER Badge.\n\n\nIt was developed at the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\nIt has these.\n\n\nAudio output via 3.5 mm headphone jack.\n\n\nFlash memory capacity.\n\n\nIR communication.\n\n\nLED display capable of showing graph and scrolling texts.\n\n\nMicrophone for audio sampling.\n\n\nPager motor for vibratory feedback.\n\n\nRF communication.\n\n\nAnd a lot of other connectors for these.\n\n\nLCD Display.\n\n\nAttaching other sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best known communication badge is the Vocera Communication Badge.\n\n\nThe system has a servers that maintains these things.\n\n\nBadge session identifiers.\n\n\nEmail addresses.\n\n\nNames.\n\n\nTelephone numbers.\n\n\nVoice dialing phrases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Vocera Communication Badge is more into communication rather than sociometric measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current state of the art of Sociometric Badge is to measure individual and group behavior in social sciences.\n\n\nResearchers should not worry anymore to conduct social test using interviews or surveys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveys and observations are time consuming and this Sociometric Badge is here as an experimental research platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey expect Sociometric Badge to have high demand in research communities and later in consumer market for self monitoring devices.\n\n\nSo expect this to be in researchers hand first then in end consumers hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main functionality of this Sociometric Badge is to automatically capture individual and group pattern of social behaviors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater this social pattern can be used to determine these matters.\n\n\nIdentify social affinity from this person to another person.\n\n\nUnconscious signals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore so, Sociometric Badge need to be able to provide feedback to its user (either real time or not).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe method of capturing social signals is different than using the expensive camera to videotaping social interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect observation of humans by humans is expensive.\n\n\nThis also limited to the number of observer.\n\n\nObservers do not always agree on matters (I am not sure what they meant by this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing camera is expensive and limited to a particular space (well not anymore, nowadays you can buy cheap and small camera).\n\n\nSurveys is inaccurate and time consuming.\n\n\nBelow are examples of Sociometric Badge implementations.\n\n\nIntelligent hospitals.\n\n\nKnowledge management and collaboration tools.\n\n\nPersonal sales coach.\n\n\nSensible organizations.\n\n\nThe future of health care.\n\n\nVirtual worlds and social networking sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensible organizations mean to make an organization to give feedback and know the social structure within the organization.\n\n\nThe Sociometric Badge offered capability to these matters.\n\n\nCapable of monitoring human behavior.\n\n\nExtracting meaningful information.\n\n\nProvides the employees with performance evaluations and recommendations.\n\n\nProvides the manager with group performance metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge management and collaboration tools is basically my idea about building people wiki.\n\n\nKnowledge management and collaboration tools provides employees with a knowledge base for discovering other colleagues working with similar projects or colleagues that has specific expertise and specific interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis knowledge management and collaboration tools automatically monitors organization social structure adn group people based on their knowledge and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example these are things that the knowledge management and collaboration tools can do.\n\n\nData mining of digital documents.\n\n\nFace to face interaction.\n\n\nMonitoring emails.\n\n\nMonitoring instant messaging.\n\n\nMonitoring other form of communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure if the points about monitoring are correct or if I just misinterpret things.\n\n\nNevertheless, the knowledge management and collaboration tools provides information on how social structure within an organization works.\n\n\nThen give hints on how to engineer and optimize organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other implementations of this Sociometric Badge is in health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge can be used as a self monitoring device that alerts user if their family members has early symptoms of depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge can be used as well to monitor daily activities of elderly people.\n\n\nFor example it can detect falls of behavioral changes, then alert the nearby family members or medically capable of this potentially dangerous situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing is for managing obesity.\n\n\nSociometric Badge and mobile phone could be used to keep track of these things.\n\n\nEnergy expenditure.\n\n\nFood intake.\n\n\nDaily routines.\n\n\nProvides feedback and suggestions to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother implementations of Sociometric Badge is to make intelligent hospitals.\n\n\nThis is similar on what Vocera Badge has achieved.\n\n\nIn this paper Sociometric Badge can be used to provide information on location and specific person for right moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOften time errors occur during nurse time - shifts.\n\n\nThis wearable device can be used to monitor interaction between nurses and alert them on what kind information that should be told that would reduce the amount of errors incurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge can be used as well to provide doctor in emergency situation.\n\n\nTo track patients as they moved from one to another facility within the hospital.\n\n\nTo transfer patient's psychological data as they moved inside the hospital or for future reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge can be used as a personal sales coaching as well.\n\n\nIt tells the user on what kind of matters will pull or push costumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge gives advice on how to interact with clients more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem was at that moment (2007) sales were lacking on sufficient feedback on their selling capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop performing sales usually have these skills.\n\n\nExhibit a lot of enthusiasm.\n\n\nForm a personal bond with the customer.\n\n\nHave a good communication skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge can also be used in virtual worlds and social networking sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction in online video games and social networking sites is limited to text chat.\n\n\nHowever, Sociometric Badge can offer different layer of communication by knowing personal social signals to other player within world wide web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge provides new dimension of communication support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe long term goal of Sociometric Badge is to set interventions and recommendations that can lead to better individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronics will eventually become smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHence, Sociometric Badge will also become light weight and smaller.",

For example like motor or sensor.\n\n\nThen children can connects these bricks together and programs it to give new functionality to the bricks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Programmable Bricks can be used to create autonomous creatures (simply say it robot).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the problem with the Programmable Bricks is that the student need to learn the basic knowledge first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Programmable Bricks teach children about basic feedback and control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir newest Programmable Bricks are called Crickets.\n\n\nIt has a Wikipedia entry, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_Cricket\n.\n\n\nThe product name is PicoCricket.\n\n\nIt made by MIT Media Art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a Programmable Beads that can be used to teach children about mathematics sequences.\n\n\nThe Programmable Beads has a central micro controller and at basic it has LED.\n\n\nAt basic the programmable beads has an example of 1 dimensional automata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren can use pre - programmed features of the Programmable Beads to observe lightning patterns from the interactions.\n\n\nFor more advance users, they can write new program and then upload it into the beads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA string of Programmable Beads can be viewed as a physical instantiation of a 1 dimensional cellular automata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a programmable ball called BitBall.\n\n\nChildren can codes and upload the codes into the BitBall via infrared communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitBall can also be used for scientific purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example BitBall can be used to understand acceleration.\n\n\nIt says here that this method can be used to easily transfer new contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BitBall can be thrown to air then it will graph the acceleration data in order to find its top trajectory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was this Thinking Tag that is based on traditional badge.\n\n\nThe differences is that it can contact other Thinking Tag using infrared communication.\n\n\nThen it will react accordingly based on the received communication.\n\n\nI think here most badges that I have been looked into has infrared communications.

            "text": "This is my review from the main UbER Badge paper.\n\n\nEspecially for the hardware part, there are a lot of specifications that I do not understand.\n\n\nSo this review is all about everything that I can understand from the paper.\n\n\nThere are left a lot of things that is not mentioned here from the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of project in MIT Media Art about defining and manipulating people interaction in large group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbER Badge is made specifically to be as flexible as possible.\n\n\nThus, it can be made to manage as many situation as possible.\n\n\nThis is the main quality that my project is also aims on.\n\n\nHowever, there is no information that shows on how extensible it was. Or, how can you extend the UbER Badge.\n\n\nAs far as I see the circuitry is pretty static and there are no input - output pins left for extension like it is in Arduino or Raspberry PI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbER Badge is made as a social sensor in areas where wearable and social computing converge.\n\n\nFrom social game, meeting, convention, and later office environment.\n\n\nEspecially the term \"social computing\" hits me here.\n\n\nI think the term \"social computing\" is also bent into \"social computing\" as it is in social networking or blogging. There is no mean anymore on \"social computing\" as it is in physically social.\n\n\nWhat I found in \"social computing\" Wikipedia (\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_computing\n) entry is this.\n\n\nSocial computing is an area of computer science that is concerned with the intersection of social behavior and computational systems. It is based on creating or recreating social conventions and social contexts through the use of software and technology. Thus, blogs, email, instant messaging, social network services, wikis, social bookmarking and other instances of what is often called social software illustrate ideas from social computing, but also other kinds of software applications where people interact socially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, yeah the term is not anymore about \"social computing\" as it is physically social.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis badge has RF and IR.\n\n\nThe RF is mostly used as a local positioning system (perhaps, also as a distance/proximity detection).\n\n\nThe IR is used for face - to - face detection as well, in some cases, as local positioning system.\n\n\nSo, in most cases the environment should matter. However, in my project the environment is not matter (I even do not do anything about the environment where the badge is in).\n\n\nThe environment is used as a place to place beacon for local positioning system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here is the hardware specification.\n\n\nThe audio input and output is at 12 - bit resolution. Which is decent.\n\n\nThere are 3 on - boards processor that I do not know what are the usage of these.\n\n\nThere is 256 MB flash memory for UbER Badge main storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronics badge is part of ubiquitous computing.\n\n\nWhat is ubiquitous computing?\n\n\nBased on Wikipedia, ubiquitous computing (or \"ubicomp\") is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. In contrast to desktop computing, ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format.\n\n\nThe most important thing is the latest part, \"... ubiquitous computing can occur using any device, in any location, and in any format.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine of sight ID code enables to proximate devices to be aware of individual presence.\n\n\nIn Sociometer they use more like low powered infrared device to capture only close person - to - person interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlivetti Research Active Badge using infrared transceiver to map people around specific area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dynamic display take inspiration from the other 2 similar project which are Thinking Tag and Meme Tag.\n\n\nI think they switched up here.\n\n\nIn here they said that Meme Tag uses large display LCD to display users selectively phrases.\n\n\nWhere as Meme Tag is actually uses 16 X 2 LCD display that is not that big.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of UbER Badge.\n\n\nAs you can see there are a lot of embedded device.\n\n\nMoreover, I cannot see if there are any room for modular attachment like Arduino shield or Raspberry PI hat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some features those are not in the previous badge (I think they meant Meme Tag and Thinking Tag) but exists in UbER Badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average current flow of this badge is 100 mA with 4 AAA batteries powered up this badge, this badge can last longer for 15 hours.\n\n\nHowever, the price is quite steep, it cost 65 US Dollars without the front display panel.\n\n\nNearly twice the price of full blown Raspberry PI.\n\n\nI still need to check the inflation rate at the point they made UbER Badge though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I should have used low - powered micro - controller.\n\n\nThere are 2 main requirements for choosing the micro - controller.\n\n\nFast.\n\n\nLow powered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main aspects are these.\n\n\nFor flexibility.\n\n\nFor longevity.\n\n\nFor speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood example of system architecture diagram.\n\n\nThere supposed to be a meaning for each shapes used in this diagram. However, I do not know what purpose each shape has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPWM channels.\n\n\nThere are button as well to interface with the device.\n\n\nThere are audio input and audio output (headphone jack) both works with 12 - bit sample rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIR communication to detect face - to - face detection and local communication.\n\n\nSo, IR transceiver is used for these matters.\n\n\nFace - to - face detection.\n\n\nLocal communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RF is used for larger distance and wider bandwidth communication.\n\n\nThe term \"communication\" used here is rather vague in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the IR transceiver details.\n\n\nIR transmitter with 17 - degree spread.\n\n\nIR receiver with these.\n\n\nDemodulator.\n\n\nPhotodiode.\n\n\nPhotodiode Amplifier.\n\n\nProcessor (why it is necessary to have processor in IR receiver? filter?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IR communication is active in 3 meters.\n\n\nThe processor used in the IR receiver has a RS232 port that I assume it is a Serial communication chip to connect to household computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of this badge should be used in larger group settings.\n\n\nAt basic there is some identification in their badge with respect to the wearer.\n\n\nThe data is not real time as it is manual transfer from the badge to kiosk based computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther social feature of this badge.\n\n\nYou can have \"last seen...\" as it is in WhatsApp or Facebook integrated into this badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was something like treasure hunt games where people hunt clues in the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of local positioning system using IR beacon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe context of face - to - face meeting can be known by exploring and selecting which audio features should be recorded by the UbER Badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the Treasure Hunt game I mentioned several points above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see here, the local positioning system is actually always there for this kind of electronics badge.\n\n\nIt is used to data which people is on which room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example of Midnight Madness physical game in Manhattan in 2003.\n\n\nIt is real - life Pokemon Go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbER Badge packs a whole lot features into compact form factor.\n\n\nThere are many different application to be explored.",

            "text": "This is the main research paper for Spinner. Spinner is a network those are wearable sensors, environment sensors, as well as simple video recording camera.\n\n\nThe main idea of this project is to create automatic video journal through the day of its wearer.\n\n\nThe wearer can choose a plot pattern (for example from Kung - Fu Kids or Star Wars) for the video the Spinner will generate.\n\n\nSo, in the end the video produced will have the same social tension as the pattern, but featuring the wearer of Spinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this paper is basically just a project proposal.\n\n\nBut this paper is as structured as it is research paper though.\n\n\nWhat is the different between research paper and project proposal in this project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Doctor Of Philosophy\" is this what you get from graduating from MIT Media Arts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Alex \"Sandy\" Pentland guy again. He is everywhere on my project actually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinner is designed as a novel network system.\n\n\nWhat is novel?\n\n\nBased from Dictionary.com (\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/novel?s=t\n), \"novel\" is a a new kind, different from anything or known before.\n\n\nSo basically, \"novel\" is a word I can use to describe something that is new or an innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video capturing feature is to capture fragmented events of human behavior(, that, I think will be according to the pattern that the user choose).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video capture will be then arranged and gave cohesive narrative to make larger meaning.\n\n\nThe \"larger meaning\" meant so that the resultant video can be understood by anyone and not just an abstract collage of videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project will consists of these.\n\n\nWearable sensors.\n\n\nEnvironmental sensors.\n\n\nVideo sensors to identify and then record events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of choosing from the pre - made narrative patterns, user could also make their own narrative patterns.\n\n\nThese patterns, then, can be uploaded and shared to the online community.\n\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to investigate, a method to do these into large amount and arbitrary data.\n\n\nUnderstanding.\n\n\nReducing.\n\n\nPresenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper the state of the art is actually in later chapter 5.\n\n\nThis is probably because this is not research paper but more as research proposal.\n\n\nThen, this is actually a really good research proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project also take care the concern of privacy, security, as well as the use of human being as a subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is meant to make a sensors network to identify disjoint - events.\n\n\nThe \"disjoin - events\" meant that anything those the camera capture is an independent event to each other events.\n\n\nHowever, these events will contribute, directly or not, to the bigger storyline that is according to the pattern choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of this project, I think, is that the system need to be context aware.\n\n\nThe patterns are necessary to be built with the sensors those are used within this project.\n\n\nSo, using the value received from sensors, then, pattern can be created.\n\n\nThis means that the whole is system will not be scalable, in term of, when there are new sensors, all existing patterns will not have these new sensors considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as I was reading this paper, I know that I miles away from him, lol.\n\n\nIn this paper the parameters are these.\n\n\nConflict and agreement.\n\n\nSocial respect.\n\n\nDistance of each users.\n\n\nIf the goals of each users is the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these parameters, then, the story pattern can be made.\n\n\nA pattern and then feed back into the network to further detect if there are any similar pattern currently happen.\n\n\nThe user can tweak the pattern manually as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt basic this sensors network will be able to detect these.\n\n\nAttention level.\n\n\nConflict level.\n\n\nContextual change within activities.\n\n\nLocation.\n\n\nGestures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese values will be then feed to undermine higher level to create the narrative parameters (honestly, I might not understand this sentence really well, if so, I am sorry :().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs if there is a real - world pattern that fit the mapping they can be captured by imaging and audio sensors.\n\n\nThe features then will be extracted to see where they fit the pattern supplied by the user.\n\n\nThe result will be a complete story that follows the dynamic according to the pattern.\n\n\nThe values from the parameters will be still as it was captured by the sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the people and the specifics of the relationships are maintained. Honestly, I am not sure what this meant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with video capturing is that not all the whole length of the video is important.\n\n\nProcessing and trying to understand the whole video are lengthy activity.\n\n\nThis project solve this problem with sensing the narrative dynamics of an event.\n\n\nSo there is like an automation that automatically sort which clips are more important than the most as well as each of their timestamps.\n\n\nThe developer/user can also search for a clip with certain characteristic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main implementation of this project is a new type of entertainment.\n\n\nWhere the participants, the users, of Spinner will watch their life video summarized into smaller watch - able video according the pattern that they use.\n\n\nThis can provide new perspective into everyday metaphorically linking real activities from activities that the participant were not aware before.\n\n\nThe result of this project is like a journal or video blog with the story model similar to the pattern choose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants, then, can share their stories as well as their custom pattern into a website platform.\n\n\nThe writer of this project proposal, hoped that this (the point above) can lead into the creation of community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main principle of narrative is to absorb knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrative/story is a tool to extract and communicate meaning.\n\n\nThe narratives that someone develop for their life provide insight into their life and world around them.\n\n\nThese are essentials to one's education, entertainment, and social well - being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was this Russian Formalist School began to study narratology in 1920.\n\n\nNarrative is divided into two.\n\n\nFabula, which is story themes, characters, and main point.\n\n\nSyuzhet, which is the structures of the whole story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was this guy named, Vladimir Propp that worked on Russian folktales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Propp suggested that fabula is made from a set of available pattern like the traditional \"hero saves a damsel\", ....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrative requires very specific basic elements to convey its moral.\n\n\nI think this is based on basic human virtue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the system can be modeled (Dynamical System), we can know, extract, more cohesive and effective narrative out of big stream of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system provides detailed and often visually observable view from the user.\n\n\nThe goal then is to use the (above point's) information as an input to a variety monitoring application to detect patterns and predict future events.\n\n\nI think what he meant here by monitoring application is actually a machine learning.\n\n\nBack at the time this project proposal was written the term \"machine learning\" is not yet grasped in the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project started by sensors gathering simple states.\n\n\nUsually qualitative data, like \"yes\" or \"no\" or whether a person in a certain room or not as well as the name of the room.\n\n\nThis is the most important thing that gasped me, the most important question to answer is not actually \"what...\" or \"when...\" but more towards \"why...\".\n\n\n\"Why...\" matters more because in any interaction the context should be known. More so, this project wants to joint independent events together, so the context of each events need to be known (inferred manually from the system).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributed camera network was booming when the time this project proposal was written.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a foot print problem.\n\n\nVideo sensors, caused the system to be power hungry.\n\n\nSometimes not all features from a captured video are necessary to get the qualities/quantities that the system needs to, then, matches it to the supplied pattern.\n\n\nSo, in order to keep the video small and as necessary as possible, the video need to be filtered, take only the most important parts as well as only take the necessary features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video filters should be able to filter the fed videos based on the content and make sure to us only the clips those are relevant and convey something important to the end user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe filtering can be done using the value from other sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sensors filter all the videos over their duration and return only clips those are relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman - centric project to create new perspectives in our lives and identify each self in a larger social group.\n\n\nThis paper's project is meant to capture, find, and to present narrative from daily life of its users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the image sensors, this whole sensors network is capable to tell the desired story (I do not know what does this means by \"desired story\") and then present it to the participant (is the participant is the user/wearer of the Spinner bracelet or anyone else that look into the resultant video?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis whole sensor network needs to be able to chunk down large videos and re - construct it back into cohesive narrative.\n\n\nIt hoped to bring previously unmemorable and unnoticed events of one's life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major goal of this project is to create a new form of entertainment.\n\n\nFor example, YouTube has the biggest repository of user created content.\n\n\nFrom this narrative - aware system everyone can automatically create video from clips that follows the pattern the was supplied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of user scenario, I think I should have made something like this for my current project as well.\n\n\nThis gives you and the reader expectation on what to see from your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the resultant of this project is to create a networked sensors that able to know the context of recorded video of its user, based on the previously supplied pattern by the user.\n\n\nThere will be a lot, long, videos recorded by the video camera.\n\n\nIn order to keep the foot print low, this project needs to chunk the video into smaller pieces and only re - construct the most meaningful ones.\n\n\nHowever, looking for which contents/videos those are relevant through many users and videos is not an easy tag.\n\n\nDatabase is necessary.\n\n\nOr, another solution would be to tag everything that is ever inputed to the system.\n\n\nThen tagging convention need to be determine.\n\n\nI, personally, think that the good qualities of tagging are there.\n\n\nCan be identify by others easily.\n\n\nName should be the most basic name ever (preferably like 2 words).\n\n\nScalable to future additional tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this paper these qualities are these.\n\n\nEach chunks need to be easily.\n\n\nRetrieved.\n\n\nSorted.\n\n\nUsed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganized into meaningful categories.\n\n\nRespect to the these detection parameters.\n\n\nAttention level.\n\n\nConflict level.\n\n\nContextual change within activities.\n\n\nLocation.\n\n\nGestures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstandable by the system (I think this is more into coding wise).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman centric social network, will be deployed. This will capable to evaluating sensed events with respect to the pattern as well as to the detection parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective narrative needs to be developed and mapped into the capability of the sensor networks.\n\n\nThere are 3 dimensions in this project.\n\n\nUser interface.\n\n\nInternal mappings are the logic and programming, I suppose.\n\n\nThe hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these cycled back to the user interface as the main media of human to machine interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sensors can detect something that happens in real life that contributes to something in the overall final resultant video.\n\n\nThe pattern supplied in the beginning (for example the Kung - Fu Kids or Star Wars) contribute to the sensors detection with respect to the 170 parameters those are in the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory energy is an effect that the current situation in the narrative has on the characters as well as the real life audience.\n\n\nIt can further explained by polarity of (positive, negative, and neutral) and the intensity of the situation.\n\n\nFor example, an event of the death of important character means negative polarity with high intensity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of interactive drama based on the real life physical action of the watcher.\n\n\nWhen there are tension in the narrative and the watcher tries to type or speak something, the narrative will adjust the storyline based on that action from the watcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept of ticking clock.\n\n\nWhen the characters nearly or reached their goal the narrative becomes more intensive.\n\n\nUp until the goal is achieved the conflict level will keep raising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrototype of the image nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts components are these.\n\n\nARM Processor for running an operating system.\n\n\nCMOS Camera.\n\n\nFlash storage device.\n\n\nMicrophone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image nodes uses RF as the main connection to wireless data.\n\n\nThis RF connects from the user worn sensor node to the image nodes.\n\n\nThis RF communicate to the image node of when they need to start capturing for a video clip.\n\n\nThe sensors module's position is not fixed. It will be worn and move along its wearer.\n\n\nThe image module's position is fixed. Unless, if a movable drone is implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis device uses WiFi as well, as the back - end infrastructure for the whole image network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess the main idea here is for the image module to be versatile and can be equipped with plethora of sensors as the developer wanted to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the picture of the sensors module.\n\n\nI think this is the wearable technology that will be worn by the user.\n\n\nThere are some features those need to be exists for the sensors module.\n\n\nThe sensors module needs to be wearable.\n\n\nIt says to have the best access to the human subject.\n\n\nSomething like this might as well be in embedded object or in loose environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocateable, this sensors module need to be able to locate themselves within the network it is in. As well as to communicate to stationary modules if this wearable sensors module is nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, so these are the sensors itself.\n\n\nInertia.\n\n\nGesture.\n\n\nAural.\n\n\nOptical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese sensor are used to determine these.\n\n\nActivity.\n\n\nAffect.\n\n\nSocial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to understand events that make up lives.\n\n\nMapping from the sensor value into qualitative parameter is hard.\n\n\nEspecially if you deal with more social aspect of human being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, based from this paragraph the real cue here is that the sensors network that this project trying to make is all about mapping from the sensor values match it with the supplied pattern then stitch together the video clips back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think these below are the similar projects or at least projects those are inspired this project by Mathew Laibowitz.\n\n\nThese projects are about sensing human behavior.\n\n\nNathan Eagle's Reality Mining Project. This is actually more like a book from MIT Press. The book store link is here, \nhttps://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reality-mining\n.\n\n\nSingh's LifeNet, from searching from Google the only information I can know is that this project is about health care.\n\n\nThe famous UbER Badge Project.\n\n\nWeld's work in personalized user interface. I think here is the project's paper, \nhttp://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/research/supple/\n.\n\n\nWolf's work on understanding the purpose of travel data from GPS. I think the paper is here, \nhttps://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/trb/wolf.pdf\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first parameter discussed within this paper, which is conflict.\n\n\nThere is no exact, sure, way to define conflict.\n\n\nHowever, conflict level can be determined by using these parameters.\n\n\nActivity level.\n\n\nBody movement.\n\n\nEngagement.\n\n\nGesture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing that can easily be detected is a matching gesture.\n\n\nIf people in conversation nodding (or at least have the same gesture) then it is safe to say that the conflict level is low.\n\n\nIn general sympathetic agreement can denote sign of agreement.\n\n\nIn general contentious agreement can denote sign of conflict.\n\n\nIf both party is talking in similar volume it can indicate sign of agreement as well.\n\n\nThe interesting part is about the distance between the speaker.\n\n\nIf the distance between speaker is rather far than how far it is in average conversation, the conversation denote lack of interest between the participant.\n\n\nIf the distance to close it can denote that there is a problem within the conversation or means that there is a superiority among the participant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, I am not sure on how can this system know if the participant is not currently sitting in the table.\n\n\nSitting in the table means every participants have a fixed distance to each other, until they leave the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sum up, people in agreement find a rhythm of communication both verbally and body language (if the quality of verbal communication and body language are in sync then it save to assume that people within the conversation are in agreement).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing is that there are a lot of specific gesture that denote agreement or conflict, although the qualities above are not met.\n\n\nFor example.\n\n\nHandshake is a clear sign of agreement.\n\n\nClenched fist can be inferred as a conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says here as well that relative body position can denote agreement or conflict.\n\n\nHug denote agreement.\n\n\nFacing someone face denote that there is a conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf people are highly engaged steadily for decent length of time, this can denote high level agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is no rhythm in the conversation (people engage and disengage rapidly), this can indicate that there is a conflict within the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, to contra to the previous point.\n\n\nIf the participants in a conversation are disengaged, it could imply that there is not enough information given the conversation topic.\n\n\nIn this case this interaction could not be used to determine whether there is a conflict or agreement.\n\n\nSo, to sum up, if participants is not in the same level of knowledge, agreement or conflict could not be determined from their conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second aspect mentioned here is social respect.\n\n\nThis means about the social standing of each participant in the conversation (for example if someone is a boss or parent to the other participant).\n\n\nThis can be inferred from these aspect.\n\n\nFace to face time.\n\n\nBody language.\n\n\nConversational dynamics (this is what the \"rhythm\" I mentioned in several points above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike agreement or conflict, social respect can only be determined by aggregating all parameters together. So the longer the interaction happens the more accurate social respect value that this system gets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, actually it is stated here that social respect can be mapped as fast as possible according to the level of the engagement between the participant.\n\n\nThere are two different kind of engagement.\n\n\nEngagement due to social respect.\n\n\nEngagement due to situational content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngagement in social interaction could happen in 2 ways.\n\n\nThe first is engagement that happens gradually. So the engagement level started out low and then process to high.\n\n\nThe second type of engagement is engagement that directly start at higher value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next qualities that this project are looking for is what is the goals of the interaction.\n\n\nThere are 2 theories those have been mentioned before in this notes I made.\n\n\nThe first theory is about how \"why\" is more important to know than other wh - based questions.\n\n\nThe later is about the time ticking theory. This theory describes that as the character delve more into their goals the engagement level as well as the conflict level (usually) become higher (as the situation becoming more intense).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paragraph, it explains how every characters have their own goal curve.\n\n\nThis goal curve indicates how far away this certain character to achieve their goal.\n\n\nFor example, if the narrative contains goals such that the characters has a consecutive goals over another, the graph will be like sawtooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal curve can be mapped according to a parameters that indicating a \"search\".\n\n\nI am not sure what they meant by \"search\" here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, later it is explained in this paragraph that \"search\" means a rapid changes in location as well as in physical state.\n\n\nConstant change in curve can mean that the attention of the user changing faster than usual, for example when this user is talking into more people than usual and happens more frequently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if a person increase their use of certain tools, for example from the Internet into their cellphone, tablet, ..., these can indicate a larger distance from reaching the corresponding user's goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial interaction can happen in one way for example eavesdropping or stalking.\n\n\nAlthough there is no direct interaction as a feedback, this kind of social interaction affect on how someone would behave to the object.\n\n\nThis can relate as well to the object's objective (for pun purposes, although \"goal\" would be clearer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next parameter is story energy.\n\n\nStory energy means the current impact of the situation to the audiences.\n\n\nAs this was described before, this can be inferred as a positive or negative.\n\n\nI think in some previous point these mentioned as a polarity of the narrative. Whether at a point in a narrative it can be positive, negative, or neutral.\n\n\nIn simplest story energy meant how happy or how sad the narrative make the audience feel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think after several test, the researcher of this paper (Mathew Laibowitz) infer that there was a case that a happy scene detected, although it is supposed to be negative (exact opposite from what it was detected).\n\n\nIt is possible to determine happiness through body motion and/or speech qualities.\n\n\nHowever, facial and speech recognition need more sophisticated analysis to get a bare decent information to make conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said in this paragraph that if the character in the story has a connection to someone else in real world, it is possible to train the system to determine story energy.\n\n\nI assume this is using machine learning.\n\n\nHowever, in this paper there is nothing mentioned about how or even the starting point to determine the story energy.\n\n\nIn general, people has these indications to determine happiness.\n\n\nBreathing.\n\n\nGait. What is gait?\n\n\nBased from Google, gait means the manner of a person when walking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHand position.\n\n\nPosture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for this paper, I think the researcher make a general assumption on how to determine happiness or sadness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easier solution would be to train the system, feed it with known example, and provide the valuation manually.\n\n\nFor example, we feed the pattern of when Han Solo killed in Episode 7 (SPOILER shitters hahaha). The system cannot infer anything from this. However, human could just give the sadness value into this particular scene.\n\n\nHence, if later this system found similar pattern, it knows, that, this is more - or - less in similar sadness as when Han Solo died.\n\n\nDesigning valuation is hard when every parameter is qualitative.\n\n\nSo far I know that this system as well as Sociometer uses machine learning.\n\n\nSociometer uses Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect if conversation happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample solution for machine learning at that time is NeuroSolution, \nhttp://www.neurosolutions.com/\n.\n\n\nI think I can use Microsoft Azure for this matter as well.\n\n\nThis paper was written in 2007, there were less option on established machine learning platform.\n\n\nAlthough Azure is from Microsoft, it is the most user friendly option available for machine learning we currently have (this note is written in 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research proposal define a fail - able condition. To sum up, this condition is to make sure that the system is able to capture, collect, and make the resultant video make sense to the commonalty watcher.\n\n\nThe resultant video need to be cohesive as well.\n\n\nI think what this paper meant by cohesive is that the resultant video has little to no footprint.\n\n\nFootprint means that every elements is useful and not even a single thing is left unused.\n\n\nI think at basic, the user understand the content of the resultant video.\n\n\nI think at more advance, anyone understand the content of the resultant video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point before this and this point is actually trying to convey the fail - able conditions by defining some quality questions.\n\n\nIs the video resultant cohesive?\n\n\nIs the video resultant consider the pattern supplied?\n\n\nWill the resultant video similar if the settings are different (I do not get about this point actually)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther testing would be manually doing the automatic process of the system.\n\n\nThis system automatically stitch together video fragments from bigger video into 1 bigger cohesive video.\n\n\nIf this is done by human, will the resultant video the same or similar to the resultant video that is generated from the system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more ideal case, events can be overwritten by the system if it is considered as inappropriate or can be overwritten by manual human hand.\n\n\nThe system can be trained in more specific environment.\n\n\nFor higher success rate manual control could be instantiated somewhere during the process of this system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the resultant video is understandable then the whole system is valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project proposal listed some contributions as well.\n\n\nThis section is like why this project is important.\n\n\nAlthough, as you can see here, they are mostly about entertainment and community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome example of completed work.\n\n\nThese were something those had been done by the researcher of this paper prior this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in this project, this researcher can easily ask for sponsorship for his project.\n\n\nI think this is one benefit of having high education degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity is actually a concern in this project.\n\n\nAlthough, this project is just for experimental, since this project's subject is human personal life then privacy is matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of time line.\n\n\nShould I implement something like this as well in my paper?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis paper also listed in resources those are necessary for this on - going project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project proposal put the state of the art in the end of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sum up this project is about distributed sensors network on human and social interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem for the sensor node is the size as well as option to have the controller to be in low power.\n\n\nThere was SenseCam from Microsoft that brought image gathering to a small, low power node.\n\n\nThis is the website of SenseCam, \nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sensecam/\n.\n\n\nSenseCam mentioned as personal black box.\n\n\nHowever, I think the project was never reached into consumer level.\n\n\nI definitely need to look at this project since it is similar to my first prototype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Panoptes System developed at OHSU shows the problem in high foot - print video camera.\n\n\nThe main problem was when sending data even when there is no network coverage.\n\n\nThis is the related link to download The Panoptes research paper, \nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=957013.957132\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometer and UbER Badge are one of the state of the art for this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Collaborative Knowledge Building By Smart Sensor\" by Bove and Mallet's paper.\n\n\nThe link to download paper, \nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047582.30576.7e\n.\n\n\nThis paper is about decentralizing data gathering from sensory devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is StoryNet that is collection of story pattern.\n\n\nThis can be used to predict what happened next in any story.\n\n\nThink what the researcher meant here is that there is an API or something for him to take data to predict what will happen next within any story.\n\n\nLink to StoryNet, \nhttp://www.storynet.org/\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final proposed specifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the node is actually using Real Time OS from Windows CE kernel.\n\n\nWhy not using FreeRTOS though?

In general this means that any time a person is sitting or lying down, they are engaging in sedentary behavior.\n\n\nThis definition is taken from this website, \nhttp://www.sedentarybehaviour.org/what-is-sedentary-behaviour/\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, I think wearable camera can be used as measurement from what they are usually multiple sensor.\n\n\nMeasurement then will be given by the software analysis tools.\n\n\nI suggest that this software analysis tool is like a \"state of the art\" computer vision program to sort the video based on events that the user wants to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWearable camera can be used to detect these kind of behaviors.\n\n\nActive travel behavior (walking, ...).\n\n\nNutrition related behavior (diet, ...).\n\n\nSedentary behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this person named Aiden R. Doherty from Department Of Public Health from University Of Oxford.\n\n\nI am not sure is he will be relevant in my project or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of using camera is to make the wearer to be able to recall events precisely after reviewing images back from the camera.\n\n\nAdditionally, immediate cognitive function might also improve.\n\n\nI am not sure what is immediate cognitive function?\n\n\nThe closest Google search query result in Wikipedia entry about working memory.\n\n\nWorking memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that is responsible for temporarily holding information available for processing.\n\n\nBasically the short - term memory as it is mentioned in my course about learning on how to learn.\n\n\nHere is the link to the Wikipedia page, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this paper titled, \"Using The SenseCam To Improve Classifications Of Sedentary Behavior In Free - Living Settings\".\n\n\nIn this paper there will be defined what is the advantage of using camera compared to use any sensor like accelerometer.\n\n\nThe thing here is that, when studying about human interaction there should be context for every value input from sensor.\n\n\nWith accelerometer context agent is necessary.\n\n\nSo why not using whole video instead.\n\n\nIn the end there would be context agent that would likely to be human.\n\n\nThere is this woman named Jacqueline Kerr that found TV and screen based human activity can be traced correctly by using accelerometer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end the resultant behavior will be summarized by human.\n\n\nSo in term of step, using accelerometer and video camera should not matter that much.\n\n\nHowever, information contained in accelerometer is limited.\n\n\nWhere when using camera, there could be limitless amount of thing those can be inferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy research from Ireland use video based wearable sensor to manage diet of athlete or any physically active student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenseCam provides more information regarding dietary intake patterns.\n\n\nThe informations here are such as these.\n\n\nDietary intake patterns.\n\n\nFood's brand name.\n\n\nForgotten foods.\n\n\nLeftovers.\n\n\nPortion size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis eliminates error on self - reporting on food diaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese videos also provide the professionals (doctor or nutritionist) on how to give correct and proper feedback to the SenseCam wearer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall effect of using SenseCam and doing self - evaluation is cognitive stimulant in short term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the diary entries from SenseCam was found to improve autobiographic memory by prompting events into the images.\n\n\nThere was a hypotheses about using SenseCam for memory rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for using SenseCam for memory rehabilitation further researches are still necessary.\n\n\nThere was also suggestion that wearable camera sensor like SenseCam could be use to treating neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart phone was also suggested as a possible tool to mimic and replace the functionality of SenseCam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an article by Paul Kelly about ethics on using intrusive camera based wearable sensor in public spaces.\n\n\nThere should be an ethical research about this going on the background.\n\n\nHere is the full screenshot of the full article.",

            "text": "There is this article about New Relic' Future Stack Badge.\n\n\nNew Relic is a company in data analytics.\n\n\nHere is the link to the Wired article, \nhttps://www.wired.com/2013/10/conference-badges/\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased from this article it just promoted their first conference ever in data analytics.\n\n\nIn that conference, instead given a normal conference badge, every participants were given Future Stack Badge.\n\n\nFuture Stack badge behave similar to nTag. However it is just more hackable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this IoT platform called Electric Imp.\n\n\nIt promises to connect all hardware into the Internet.\n\n\nHere is the link to buy Electric Imp, \nhttps://store.electricimp.com/collections/featured-products/products/imp001?variant=31282791826\n.\n\n\nElectric Imp is formed to be similar to SD Card.\n\n\nWhat unique is the pairing system.\n\n\nYou can setup your Electric Imp with a smart phone. You need to download a specific setup application. And then your smart phone will blink some codes. While blinking you need to tap the Electric Imp into your phone screen to transfer the setup into the Electric Imp.\n\n\nThis is pretty convenient than having to setup manually using mainstream personal computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has NFC antenna.\n\n\nSo, wireless communication can happen if there are two badges nearby to each others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt mentioned here that New Relic's Future Stack Badge can be connected to \"conference\" specific application like in Android or in iOS.\n\n\nI am not particularly sure about which application exactly. However, Electric Imp itself can be setup using its own 1st smart phone application.\n\n\nSo, I think the mentioned application is that Electric Imp 1st party application.\n\n\nIt is nice to mention that Electric Imp has an accompanying web administrator interface as well. It is similar like Microsoft Azure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe badge was used to gather statistic during the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is actually a positional sensor.\n\n\nI think in my word this would likely to be a local positioning system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith big data there are a lot can be connected. For example the connection between weather and coffee consumption to movement of participants in the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbiquitous computing.\n\n\nPut computer in anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question here is (also my question as well, actually), many attendances usually has owned a smart phone, why it is necessary to give them another electronics device?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thing is that phone is a personal device.\n\n\nAn conference is not thing that people attend gradually. Hence, not all people willing to install an application that only be used for several days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the smart phone specifications are not homogeneous. For example Apple still refuse to put NFC in their iPhone.\n\n\nHence, developing a stand - alone embedded device is the way to go since everything is standardized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nice part is that after the Future Stack conference, the hardware badge will be unlocked.\n\n\nSo the Electric Imp can be hacked as the user's needs.\n\n\nHere is the screenshot for the article.",

The term \"social\" has no necessity to interact with someone else in person anymore. Contrary to the amount of tools those are available to use to get social data from Internet activities, there are only few technologies that could be use to facilitate real-life data mining. Except for Sociometric Badge, a tool that was made specifically to measure and take quantitative data from real-life social activities.\"\n\n\n4th part, \"Sociometric Badge, offer a platform to track social activities within a determined space (conference, office building, ...). At its basic, Sociometric Badge takes the energy and pitch of its wearer's voice when social interaction happens and together infrared face-to-face detection it can determine whether a proper social interaction happen.\"\n\n\n5th part,  \"All in all, Sociometric Badge is just like a Fitbit but to track social achievement.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst paragraph.\n\n\nQuantitative social data is hard to get because the lack of social sensor.

All in all, Sociometric Badge is just like a Fitbit but to track social achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFix for first and second paragraph.\n\n\nQuantitative social data is hard to get because the lack of social sensor. More over, the values are extremely varied under slight differences in circumstances. Currently, there are three common ways to get those quantitative data, which are polls, questionnaires, and interviews.\n\n\nAs far as the time goes, the term \"social\" can go beyond real life interaction. The term \"social\" has no necessity to interact with someone else in person anymore. Contrary to the amount of tools those are available to use to get social data from Internet activities (e.g. Facebook\u2019s like button, Reddit\u2019s down vote and up vote buttons, ...), there are only few technologies that could be use to facilitate real-life social data mining. Sociometric Badge in the other hand, is a tool that was made specifically to measure and take quantitative data from real-life social activities. Sociometric Badge, offer a platform to track social activities within a pre-determined space (e.g. conference, office building, ...). At its basic, Sociometric Badge takes the energy and pitch of its wearer's voice when social interaction happens and together infrared face-to-face detection it can determine whether a proper social interaction happen. All in all, Sociometric Badge is just like a Fitbit but for social achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, move to the 3rd paragraph.\n\n\nThe paragraph 3 would be on how the Sociometric Badge works.\n\n\nWhile the paragraph 4 would be what are the problems.\n\n\nThe final paragraph would be what to expect in this project.\n\n\nDraft and also final for paragraph 3.\n\n\nThe first iteration of Sociometric Badge has abilities to measuring simple body gesture, extracting speech features (energy and pitch), radio transceiver to send and receive data over other Sociometric Badges, local positioning system from a relative base station, it knows when face-to-face interaction is happening, and Bluetooth for proximity and connection to mobile phone application. Although the Sociometric Badge can work with just face-to-face detection and speech features extraction, the focus of real-life social interaction as it is in social networking cannot be achieved without an ability to interact to other Sociometric Badge. Hence, it has build-in Bluetooth to display data to a mobile phone application and to upload data manually to a server. The current Sociometric Badge is now handled by a company named Humanyze which is from the same people who brought this badge in the first place. Compared to the first iteration, the recent Sociometric Badge has a dedicated server application and the badge is now able to stream data in real-time to the server. On that account, its wearer can receive feedback immediately. In essence, every new iterations of Sociometric Badge would emphasize on processing data in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft and final for paragraph 4.\n\n\nThe main problem of real-life social sensor is that there is no known other alternative yet aside from the Sociometric Badge. Since Sociometric Badge went inside a commercial company there are little to no update on what are the current state of the art. Furthermore, it is not as commercially available to buy, seeing there is no obvious way to buy Sociometric Badge aside from sending an email to the company. In the need of an alternative, there is recently a similar project from the same group that made Sociometric Badge. It is open source and it is called \"Rhythm Open Badge\". Rhythm Open Badge project let people to create their own Sociometric Badge. However, this raised another concern that the people that needs to get quantitative social data usually are not adept in electronics nor programming. That, and with the fact that Rhythm Open Badge is made with tools those are not well known and the lack of documentations, are what motivate this project to create better alternative of Sociometric Badge for people who has no background in electronics and programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft for paragraph 5.\n\n\nThis project will focus on what is right, what went wrong and its solutions. Next chapter will discuss on things those motivate this project. Then moves into hardware and software development, testing, problems and solutions, and the finally conclusion of this project and recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal for introduction.\n\n\nQuantitative social data is hard to get because the lack of social sensor.

Up to now, I only know \"DEFAULT\" method. I am not sure if there is other methods and if those other methods better for my case. Nevertheless, I will keep using \"DEFAULT\" for now on.\n\n\nThe 2nd parameter is a buffer before the sound sent to be processed.\n\n\nThe 3rd parameter is said to be the interval between two consecutive sound analysis. The variable used is called \nhop_size\n. Other than these, I am not sure on what does this parameter do.\n\n\nIn the example code \nhop_size\n is buffer divided by 2 and rounded up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last parameter is the sample size. I do not know what does sample size do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis website shows an example of initiating \nalsaaudio\n PCM object in Python, \nhttp://larsimmisch.github.io/pyalsaaudio/libalsaaudio.html?highlight=alsaaudio.pcm#alsaaudio.PCM\n.\n\n\nalsaaudio\n PCM object can be used to either read or record/stream from microphone.\n\n\nBecause I am going to use \nalsaaudio\n for audio recording I need to set \ntype = alsaaudio.PCM_CAPTURE\n.\n\n\nHere is an example of code of my \nalsaaudio\n object in Python.\n\n\n\n\nself.recorder = alsaaudio.PCM(\n    type = alsaaudio.PCM_CAPTURE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCM.read()\n returns a length and data tuple, \nhttp://larsimmisch.github.io/pyalsaaudio/libalsaaudio.html?highlight=alsaaudio.pcm#alsaaudio.PCM\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was wondering what does PCM means. PCM means Pulse-code Modulation. PCM is used to digitally represent analog signals, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing variable across modules in Python, \nhttps://docs.python.org/2/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-share-global-variables-across-modules\n.\n\n\nExample.\n\n\n\n\n#variable.py\nvariable_text = \"Hello world!\"\n\n\n\n\n#other.py\nimport variable\nvariable.variable_text = variable.variable_text + \" Hello world again!\"\n#This print will result in \"Hello world! Hello world again!\"\nprint(variable.variable_text)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of constant in Python. Although, Python has no specific method on how to make constant, \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/10672419/class-constants-in-python\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, constant can be treated as other normal Python variables.

Hence, \n\"./cascade-face-front-default.xml\"\n will point to \n\"~/cascade-face-front-default.xml\"\n which is non - existent.\n\n\nThe second code since I did \ncd /absolute/path/to/my/python/codes/\n the \n\"./cascade-face-front-default.xml\"\n will get into the correct file.\n\n\nGood thing to learn here are these.\n\n\nThe Python relative path is from the terminal current working directory and not relative from where the Python script is.\n\n\nSo it is better to just \ncd\n rather than using Python with absolute path like \npython -B /absolute/path/to/my/python/codes/my_open_cv_codes.py\n.",

So I need to apply line break manually.\n\n\n\n\necho \"\\ntest test\" | sudo tee -a /home/notalentgeek/Downloads/project-commitment/pc-ut-bachelor-thesis-2016/deliverable-programming/test-bash-add-config-file-1/config-test.conf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter I execute code above my .conf file is like this.\n\n\n\n\ntesttest test\n\\ntest test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently \n\\n\n is not registered as an escape character.\n\n\nI checked other example command to add line into configuration file, \nsudo /bin/sh -c 'echo \"nameserver 192.168.1.6\" >> /etc/resolv.conf'\n.\n\n\nI modify it into my need.\n\n\n\n\nsudo /bin/sh -c 'echo \"test test test\" >> /home/notalentgeek/Downloads/project-commitment/pc-ut-bachelor-thesis-2016/deliverable-programming/test-bash-add-config-file-1/config-test.conf'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting other command aside from using \necho\n, \nprintf\n.\n\n\nFrom this discussion, \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11193466/echo-without-newline-in-a-shell-script\n. I know that \necho\n is good for simple code. However, \nprintf\n can be used for more stability.\n\n\n\n\nsudo /bin/sh -c 'printf \"test test printf\" >> /home/notalentgeek/Downloads/project-commitment/pc-ut-bachelor-thesis-2016/deliverable-programming/test-bash-add-config-file-1/config-test.conf'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding line break before adding the modified codes.\n\n\n\n\nsudo /bin/sh -c 'printf \"\\n\\ntest test printf\" >> /home/notalentgeek/Downloads/project-commitment/pc-ut-bachelor-thesis-2016/deliverable-programming/test-bash-add-config-file-1/config-test.conf'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently \nprintf\n is capable to understand \n\\n\n which is nice. However, as you can see from the code above I need to add 2 \n\\n\n to get 1 line break.\n\n\nI guess the 1st line break is neglected?\n\n\nSo I need to add these into \n/etc/modules\n.\n\n\n\n\nlirc_dev\nlirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting codes.\n\n\n\n\nsudo /bin/sh -c 'printf \"\\n\\nlirc_dev\\nlirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22\" >> /home/notalentgeek/Downloads/project-commitment/pc-ut-bachelor-thesis-2016/deliverable-programming/test-bash-add-config-file-1/config-test.conf'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bash codes above is perfect.

Slow, controlled heating and cooling rates have been used to solve this problem. While this solution facilitates the manufacture of high quality components, it does so at the expense of production rate, and deterioration of the mechanical properties of the ceramic because of an increase in grain size. This solution, therefore, achieves quality at the expense of an economical production rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second paragraph is mainly about explaining what is the difficulties as well as the problem.\n\n\nThe half - later part of second paragraph, it explains on how the problems affect the current solution.\n\n\nLet's check data on how to buy sociometric badge.\n\n\nSo I have sent an email to the company that made sociometric badge, Humanyze.\n\n\nIn that email I asked whether or not there is a hardware or software development kit.\n\n\nI think this is the main problem of sociometric badge is that there is no development platform, hence there is no way for it to be fitted to what people needs.\n\n\nAnd there is also no obvious way on how to order one.\n\n\nI have seen a lot of people are asking on how to get sociometric badge.\n\n\nSo the demands are there but there is no clear way on how to access it yet.\n\n\nTo sum up the second paragraph is to determine and to explain the problem.\n\n\nNow move into the third paragraph.\n\n\nRecently, interest has been growing in alternative sintering techniques that could overcome the problem of thermal gradients more economically. One of the most promising is the use of microwaves to sinter ceramic compacts. Microwave sintering has many attractive features, including rapid volumetric heating and low cost. It may have other advantages as well, as there is some evidence that the mechanical properties of microwave-sintered ceramics are superior to those of conventionally-sintered eramics. This superiority has been largely attributed to the smaller grain sizes resulting from the short, rapid sintering cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third paragraph is more into the \"research gap\".\n\n\nBut since there is little to no research done within 2009 to now, it is hard to see what is the gap.\n\n\nSo in this section I would prefer to make some statements about what have been done so far as brief as possible.\n\n\nThose \"what have been done\" would be ....\n\n\nActually I will just go and talk about the current trends and what can those trends affect and solve problem this paper trying to solve.\n\n\nTo sum up, the third paragraph would be how recent trends could affect this project.\n\n\nThe last sentence of the introduction paragraph is this.\n\n\nUntil now, there has been no report of any systematic study of the microstructures produced by microwave sintering, or their relationship to the properties of the sintered product. The aims of this project were to compare the resultant properties and microstructure with material sintered by conventional constant heating rate rocesses. The relationships between density and grain size were studied. It was predicted that microwave sintering would alter the densification/grain growth relationship. The effects of heating rate and yttria content were also investigated. It was predicted that yttria content of ceramics sintered onventionally or by microwave would not differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first sentence is indication on what is missing in the first place.\n\n\nThe second sentence is to explain the goal of this project.\n\n\nThe last sentence is the prediction before the project began.\n\n\nThe main hypothesis of this project.\n\n\nSo to sum up the main idea of the last paragraph is to explain what is this paper/project is about.\n\n\nThe gap. The thing that is supposed to exists but it is not.\n\n\nThe current trends and how can those affect this project.\n\n\nThe goal of this project.\n\n\nThe hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last paragraph should be the structure of this paper.\n\n\nSample for introduction chapter.\n\n\nDraft.\n\n\nNowadays, social data gathering usually meant as a gathering social media data from available platform like YouTube or Facebook.\n\n\nThe classic methods on taking data for social experiment are usually involving direct interview, observation, questionnaire, or survey.\n\n\nHowever, these methods are not scalable in case additional informations are required.

As well as good practices to use to develop good platform for social data gathering.\n\n\nThis paper concludes with advices on which development platform test and what area are still left to discover and to be developed in future related works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother sample for introduction paper.\n\n\nThis paper is about a project on making an open alternative to Sociometric Badge. Sociometric Badge was first introduced in 2008, mentioned in a paper titled XXXXX. It was built to enhance group collaboration via sociometric analysis. The idea itself root from previous similar projects that meant to make real - life social networking easier by mixing people who has same interests. At the essence, Sociometric Badge is a tracking tools for people that is working in a group.\n\n\nThe main idea of this paper is how to use popular technology to leverage social data gathering. Traditionally social data gathering is carried out using interview, observation, questionnaire, and survey. However, these methods are not scalable. For instance, if there are variables those are missing, the experimenter should re - do the method again from the beginning. And while there are lot of technologies that should solve this problem, the notion of social data gathering is already shifted as it is gathering data via social network platform like Facebook or YouTube. There is little to no mention of social data gathering as it is in real - life case anymore.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is a good fit to the main idea because it allows social data to be gathered ubiquitously. At basic Sociometric Badge is able to capture voice features of its wearer as well as face to face detection with infrared transceiver. With tool like this there is no need to re - do a social observation because the variable is always monitored by inputs from Sociometric Badge. \n\n\nAfter eight year since its initial release Sociometric Badge is now molded in a company named Humanyze. Since 2011 there are little to no paper with regard to Sociometric Badge anymore. The information seems to be close tight as to prepare the company. Up until this point there are no documentation nor hardware/software development kit. This means that in case someone decided to pull cash to buy set of Sociometric Badges from Humanyze, there is no way to set the badges to suits their need unless the company steps in. \n\n\nFor commoners the main problem then is how to get their hand into Sociometric Badge in case he/she needs it. At the time this paper is written, there is no obvious way on how to buy Sociometric Badge aside from an email form at the bottom of Humanyze's website. The other solution would be on how to make an alternative to the Sociometric Badge using technologies those are widely available. However, there is little to no documentation available on what is the specifications of the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nThis gap sets a goal for this project to re - create Sociometric Badge using widely used technology. The term \"widely used technology\" meant so that the people that want to use this alternative Sociometric Badge are able to provide support to their own needs to their nearby peers. This meant that this project is also meant to complement things that Humanyze left behind, which is a good documentation and  development platforms.\n\n\nAt the beginning this paper is trying to look for possible past to recent implementations of wearable electronics that could be use to help social data gathering. This is supposed to set a standard on what is the ideal solution would be. After the ideal solution is formulated, it will be dumbed down to reach within a limited time frame, current knowledge, as well as budget. This will be then known as the realistic solution.\n\n\nAfter that this paper will try to group some potential users based on their possible role to this project. Each roles will then determine some requirements. For each requirements that intersect with roles will then get higher priorities. These requirements will then conclude into a fail - able tests. The test will be used to measure what things are missing and incomplete in future sections about Advices.\n\n\nAfter the requirements are set this paper will go through the process on making the alternative of Sociometric Badge. There will be explained on the design pattern and technical requirements (like multi threading and sample time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the conclusion, there will be the result of user test for each roles mentioned. The user tests will based on the requirements mentioned in chapter XXXXX. To close, this paper will shows advices and recommendation on future works.rks.",

            "text": "State of the art draft.\n\n\nIn this chapter I will go look though all possible implementations of Sociometric Badge. Before building the realistic solution for this project I need to chop through the Sociometric Badge into several basic principles that will be benefit the target group. Each of these principles will related to whom are this project are meant to. The main target of this project is to create a basic tool that help social scientists to leverage their social experiment, similar to the Sociometric Badge. The hypothetical basic tool mentioned is supposed to carry out only the fundamental functionalities of the Sociometric Badge. From this most basic implementation, the users can then can apply their own requirements to create their own ideal tool that suit their own needs. Specifically for this project, the users will be the social scientists who will be greatly helped to have such a tool like Sociometric Badge and the makers who will help social scientist to build and tweak the tool.\n\n\nThe main principles for Sociometric Badge as from the social scientists perspective are the usability. The main consideration for social scientists to have Sociometric Badge, is that they cannot find the perfect fit out of it. In ideal scenario, let say, when everyone has the same capability, there would be tools similar to Sociometric Badge fitted with with their own requirements for any possible needs. This project sets to create an alternative version to Sociometric Badge that shares the basic usabilities for any given cases so far. So, in order to know what kind of propositions are necessary to satisfy most of social scientists, the qualities that this project search for state of the art are the inputs, what are the promoted features of the implementations discussed here, the popularity of the technology used to make ones, media communication, how the data stored and retrieved back (whether it is automatic or manual).\n\n\nThe input that dealt in this chapter are more into which kind of data those are relevant to social experiment. Any input that comes naturally from human will be considered but a basic user experience input like a physical button will not be considered as a details that would affect social experiment, hence such details will not be included. What I meant by \"naturally comes from human\" is that the input will not be there because the human intentionally make the interaction. If human aware of their action, this should not be considered as an input, since the one of the design goal for this project is to create an ubiquitous wearable social sensor.\n\n\nThe promoted features will mainly about the main usage of the implementation. Although usually the output, any supporting features or gimmicks that support data gathering process for both the badge wearer and the social scientists should be considered. For example client - server connection or simple LCD screen to display informations.\n\n\nThe popularity of the technology used will only be considered if the implementation can be traced back within the last ten years from when this paper is written. The goal of this project is to create an alternative to the Sociometric Badge. However, the main user group, which is the social scientists, usually will not the one who create the badge but someone else with basic expertise. Hence, the more popular components used to create the implementation the better it would be for the social scientists to find this someone who will build the badge. For this purpose, I will look the popularity based on Google Trends as well as the number of results produced from specific queries related to the components/methods/tools Google search engine. Hence, for this aspect of state of the art, I need to determine what kind of components, methods, and tools are important to create the implementation. And then, I would try identify relevant search keywords to be used within Google Trends and Google search engine to determine the popularity of components, methods, and tools those are used to make the implementation.\n\n\nMedia communication is how the implementation communicate, to whom it connects into, whether it is one - way or two - way communications, and whether this happens automatically or manually. Analysis on this matter will help to determine to where data is passed into as well as to determine simple communication diagram.\n\n\nThe last part is how the data is stored and how can it be retrieved by the social scientists or general user. In general this parameter will be about the output of each implementations. Anything that shows information in the physical world, for example like web user interface, LEDs blinking, that is related to the input received from the implementation will be considered. This part will also look into how the data is stored, which database is used, or whether or not the implementation used one in the first place.\n\n\nFrom the makers perspective, this paper will look into how easy it is to make the implementation if only documentations are available for free. The documentations that this paper are looking for are the part lists, the schematics, the source codes. And for the development in this chapter the main building blocks will be defined. These building blocks are, in bigger picture, the main controller and the programming language used to program the controller.\n\n\nBy the end of this chapter, there will be implementations those are not directly related to Sociometric Badge, but it has features those are nice to have in the Sociometric Badge. These specific state of the arts will have their own specifications but the date of which each implementations known to public will be noted. This will be achieved by searching the earliest possible article within the Internet.\n\n\nFor this project, there are two main users, the social scientists and the makers. The main end user will be the social scientists those conduct social observation. However, since this paper is intended to be a starting point to create an alternative version of Sociometric Badge as well as due to my own personal experience as a maker, this project will have tendency to look state of the art implementation from technical point of view. As whole, these implementations will look into their simplicity and usability.",

            "text": "Meme Tag.\n\n\nMeme Tags are part of a body of research on GroupWear: a wearable technology that supports people in the formative stages of cooperative work. Conference participants wear Meme Tags that allow them to electronically share memes\u2014succinct ideas or opinions\u2014with each other. Alongside of the person-toperson transactions, a server system collects information about the memetic exchanges and reflects it back to the conference-goers in Community Mirrors\u2014large, public video displays that present real-time visualizations of the unfolding community dynamics. This paper presents results from a proof-of-concept trial of the Meme Tag technology undertaken at a MIT Media Laboratory conference.\n\n\nMeme Tag was first publicly known in 1997. It was made as a wearable device that helps people co - operate with each others. Meme Tag usually used in conference where the homogeneity among its participant is high. Then, Meme Tag tries to group people even further by another topics that independent to the conference topic. Thus, make people with same interest other than what it is in conference meet each others. The usage of Meme Tag is similar to nowadays Twitter, but instead of use tweet online, the wearer of Meme Tag need to meet other people in person to share their message.\n\n\nAt the point when Meme Tag was used, the process to set one is straight forward. After user register at the conference in - site, they will be guided into a computer booth where they can set their first meme (message). Then, they can share their meme by touching other Meme Tag face to face. The connection between Meme Tag to the computer booth is unknown but the peer - to - peer communication between Meme Tag to share meme is done using infrared. I would suggest that the connection between Meme Tag to the booth computer is done using infrared communication as well, since at that point USB is not yet popular and there is no cable socket found in Meme Tag part list. Moreover, there was a web server as well to hold the captured memes.\n\n\nMeme Tag formed as bare as it was. There was no case used to cover, wearer could see the LCD display directly, as well as other electronics components behind it.\n\n\nWhat this project can learn from Meme Tag is its easiness to be setup during conference where there are a lot of people in queue to get their Meme Tag setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sociometer.\n\n\nIn this paper, we describe the use of the sociometer, a wearable sensor package, for measuring face-to-face interactions between people. We develop methods for learning the structure and dynamics of human communication networks. Knowledge of how people interact is important in many disciplines, e.g. organizational behavior, social network analysis and knowledge management applications such as expert finding. At present researchers mainly have to rely on questionnaires, surveys or diaries in order to obtain data on physical interactions between people. In this paper, we show how noisy sensor measurements from the sociometer can be used to build computational models of group interactions. Using statistical pattern recognition techniques such as dynamic Bayesian network models we can automatically learn the underlying structure of the network and also analyze the dynamics of individual and group interactions. We present preliminary results on how we can learn the structure of face-to-face interactions within a group, detect when members are in face-to-face proximity and also when they are having a conversation. We also measure the duration and frequency of interactions between people and the participation level of each individual in a conversation.\n\n\nThe Sociometer described as a wearable sensor packages. It was made in 2002 for helping researcher measuring interaction between people. The development of The Sociometer not only focused on its hardware but it also took ergonomics design as its main concern. The result is a shoulder pad packed with a lot of sensors for social data gathering, that, although it is not as ubiquitous as the previous implementations, it is easy and can be comfortably worn through day. The result was that users are very happy to use it, thus its presence was neglected by the users.\n\n\nIt was equipped by microphone, accelerometer, and infrared. There are other sensor as well that can be easily attached, like for example gyroscope. The microphone was used to capture incoming sound and then has its features extracted (pitch and volume). The Sociometer used low - powered infrared to detect if face - to - face communication between its wearer happened. The accelerometer was used to know if the body language between participant in a conversation synced or nearly the same.\n\n\nAs for this project, the usage of low - powered infrared could help to determine whether face - to - face communication is currently happened. Normal infrared would detect any incoming signal as far as 5 meters. But, the low - powered one will only be detected in 1 meter range. This would ensure that only valid face - to - face communication happens. The study of form factor is a good example on how to setup less - presented wearable device. Although the size is big for a wearable electronics device, due to its ergonomics and form - factor the user will not be worn out after long time use. This technique presents another dimension of ubiquitousness, of which, device not only blend to the environment but also to its user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbER Badge.\n\n\nUbER Badge is the best example for this project. As it is in its description, it was intended to be a development platform that can be extended to satisfy any possible cases. At its most basic setup, when it was introduced in 2003, it has microphone and infrared transceiver for social data gathering as well as local positioning system using RFID. It communicate to each other with hopping transmission between other UbER Badge.\n\n\nForm wise UbER Badge has noticeable LED matrices as a display instead of LCD screen that Meme Tag uses. The basic design offers a simple casing to cover its innards.\n\n\nThis project could learn from how UbER Badge make everything to be easily extensible. The use of modular circuitry enabled other people to adjust UbER Badge to meet personal needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnTag.\n\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2003--Don't be surprised if at your next conference or gathering you run into the nTAG, the first interactive name badge created to encourage attendee networking at business and social events. While stimulating conversation, nTAGs also help organizers to deliver event information, track attendance, manage security, send messages, and evaluate surveys and polls in real time.\nWorn like regular paper badges, nTAGs exchange data with one another using infrared sensors. As attendees approach each other, information is automatically transferred from tag to tag, requiring no action from the wearer. Then the tags' LCD screens illuminate and display information on shared interests -- \"Hi Karen, we both work in the fashion apparel industry.\" Imagine a gathering where one person wants to sell a '65 Mustang and runs into someone with an nTAG beaming, \"Craig, I am selling a '65 Mustang, mint condition.\"\n\n\nnTag was first known in 2003 and it went commercial until ~2008. This wearable device was used to manage a lot of people within the same place. Although there is not specific input for social data gathering, it packed with applications to regulate people. It is mainly used in conference, \n\n\nnTag was first known in 2003 and it went commercial until ~2008. This wearable device was used to manage a lot of people within the same place, especially conference. In my opinion nTag was the Meme Tag that went commercial. It has the same sociometric principle that was also in Meme Tag, which is to exchange message within participants as well as stimulating conversation for like - minded people. On top of that nTag was packed with a applications to help conference organizers to manage a lot of people. For example is has a functionality for the organizer to throw a questionnaire that the nTag wearer can just answer right away within the badge and then display the results in real time as the wearer finished answering the questionnaire. All in all, nTag offered control for the conference organizer and networking for its wearer.\n\n\nForm wise, nTag build like a regular badge. The distinction is that it has an LCD display that can handle at least a small (~7 words) sentence.There are input buttons that I suggest these were meant as answer buttons in case of questionnaire and polling from the conference organizer. Also, there is a connection from the badge to database. The database is used to store values from questionnaires as well as other important information like the whoever had meet the wearer during the conference along with information on which room the wearer currently in. It is equipped with infrared transceiver to exchange message and RFID for local positioning system.\n\n\nnTag offers flexibility that none other implementations in this state of the art has. This is due to it has the most basic input and output, the LCD and push buttons. With these basic components the amount of things it can do is so many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge.\n\n\nA sociometric badge (commonly known as a \"sociometer\") is a wearable electronic device capable of automatically measuring the amount of face-to-face interaction, conversational time, physical proximity to other people, and physical activity levels using social signals derived from vocal features, body motion, and relative location. We have built several hundred sociometric badges and used them in real organizations to automatically measure individual and collective patterns of behavior, predict human behavior from unconscious social signals, identify social affinity among individuals working in the same team, and enhance social interactions by providing feedback to the users of our system.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is what the Sociometer has become. It is a wearable electronics device to do sociometric data gathering. It packed with a inputs such as, microphone, Bluetooth, accelerometer, and RFID. The first iteration of the Sociometric Badge came in 2007, up until the latest version which came in as an IP to a company named Humanyze. Unfortunately, since this went commercial, there are little to no information on the current development of the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nSociometric Badge packed with a lot of sensors, there are voice input from microphone, presence detection using infrared, Bluetooth to determine the proximity of the badge with other similar badge, RFID for local positioning, and accelerometer to determine body language. These all then packed into nice looking form factor that looks no different than other office badge. There are administration control panel as well control panel for regular wearer as well. The first iteration of the Sociometric Badge in 2008 has a Java based cell phone application that used to display real - time data visualization directly from the badge. However, the recent Sociometric Badge, that I have looked, needs to have its data manually moved from the badge into the main computer using Bluetooth.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is the main inspiration for this project. The goal of this project is to create the flexible development platform that was once UbER Badge with recent technologies to make an alternative to Sociometric Badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge is the newest approach to the Sociometric Badge since it went commercial. The project's first commit into its GitHub repository was on 21st January 2016. The project is still going up until this moment and it has two stable version to be used. At first, before the shutdown, Rhythm Open Badge has a Google Hangout plug - in to simulate the similar functionality of the Sociometric Badge but with online interaction in mind. Additionally, it also has an Android application to make an Android phone to be the Rhythm Open Badge itself despite some limitations.\n\n\nAlthough the project is open source, currently, it has little documentations. There are source codes available, there are Eagle CAD PCB file as well as very simple part list. But there is no way for a commoners to know how to build one by looking at the documentation that it currently has. It uses nRF51-DK a low powered Bluetooth development kit to make the device, but it does not mention to which functionalities the Bluetooth serves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe form factor is very small and what could inspire related project is the usage of low powered Bluetooth micro controller that can be powered with only a coin battery.ery.",

However, the situation would be different when later this project finishes. When this project finishes, there could be a a better development tools for this project. That, or I could have just missed an available development tools those are fitter for this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second paragraph would be my design principle on this project.\n\n\nMy design principle is that when I am not sure on what will the limitations are, what are the good development platforms, ... I will try to make everything as portable as possible.\n\n\nThe term of portability refers to codes and schematics that can be deployed in most development environment.\n\n\nChoosing general development board.\n\n\nChoosing a well - structured and well - written programming language.\n\n\nFor the development board, I will search on development board that gives the most connectivity options as well development boards that has a decent amount of input and output pins.\n\n\nHave a liberal connectivity choices.\n\n\nDecent amount of input and output pins.\n\n\nCan be developed in several programming languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor programming language, I will choose programming language that is stable, enforce programmers to write clean codes regardless the skills, and have a strong community support for the last few years.\n\n\nEnforce programmers to write clean codes regardless their skills.\n\n\nhave strong community support for the last few years.\n\n\nStable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth development board and the programming language need to have a strong standard library as well as 3rd party library of any modules that I would potentially use in this project.\n\n\nMy design principle is to have everything as portable as possible when I am not sure on what will be the hurdles later on. \"Portability\" refers to codes and electronics schematics that can be deployed in most development environments with little to no change necessary. Generally for this project, this implies to choose a general development board as well as its accompanying programming language.\n\n\nThe ideal development board for this project will be a liberal development board. The development board need to have a generous options for connectivity, decent amount of input and output pins, and will be good to have several programming languages those can be used to develop the board.\n\n\nThe ideal programming language will be a programming language that is not strictly typed but also not to liberal. Since, I am the only developer in this project, if I expect people to continue this project sometime in the future, the code must be clean, readable, and well structured. A liberal programming language with emphasize on flexible coding like JavaScript will not satisfy this requirement. This project needs to use a programming language that can enforce a writing style to any programmers regardless their skills but also adaptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last paragraph for this introduction could be on how the database is chosen.\n\n\nThis project will use a hosted database to store and maintaining data. However, since I personally is not keen on database and its practices. The chosen database and its options will be determined according to the choice of the development platform and whether the database can be programmed with the programming language of choice.",

The Sociometric Badge started from a sequence of similar researches and products. The original inspiration was from Active Badge. Between Active Badge to the Sociometric Badge, there are others similar projects. These project led into the development of the Sociometric Badge in 2008. However, after 2008, there are little to no information of the Sociometric Badge. Until, it then re - appeared as a commercial product. As the nature of common commercial products, the Sociometric Badge became a close - ended product.

These problems are what make the Sociometric Badge is not accessible to use for research purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next paragraph will be about the main inspiration for this project.\n\n\nThe obvious main inspiration for this project will be the Sociometric Badge itself.\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nThe first iteration of the Sociometric Badge that was done in 2008.\n\n\nThe latest iteration of the Sociometric Badge that went commercial under Humanyze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other inspiration will be Rhythm Open Badge a new project initiated with the help of the same professor that makes the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nThe Rhythm Open Badge is an open source project.\n\n\nThe Rhythm Open Badge has its own GitHub repository.\n\n\nAlthough, Rhythm Open Badge is open the tools and the methods used are uncommon.\n\n\nI suggest that looking for a person that could develop one will be hard.\n\n\nI suggest that the common ways to make something at this point will be using Raspberry PI and Arduino.\n\n\nThe Rhythm Open Badge uses NRF51 - DK.\n\n\nNRF51 - DK is a low powered micro - controller.\n\n\nNRF51 - DK can be just powered with a coin battery.\n\n\nNRF51 - DK have a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) for wireless communication.\n\n\nBeside the Sociometric Badge itself, the main inspiration for this project is Rhythm Open Badge.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge comes in 21st January of 2016 as an open solution that is similar to the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge is still in development.\n\n\nWithin Rhythm Open Badge project itself, there is an Android application to show - off some functionalities of the real Rhythm Open Badge.\n\n\nThe real Rhythm Open Badge currently has two versions, the first version and the third version.\n\n\nI am not sure where the second version is, but there are only the first and the third those are listed within the Wiki section of Rhythm Open Badge GitHub repository.\n\n\nThere is no apparent problem per see, except these.\n\n\nThey use NRF51 - DK as the development kit.\n\n\nNo body uses NRF51 - DK.\n\n\nThe price is also more expensive than Raspberry PI or self - made Arduino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, this project wants to initiated an alternative to the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nBut, there is Rhythm Open Badge already.\n\n\nThe thing is although Rhythm Open Badge is open source, the development is not easily modified.\n\n\nThe \"easy to modified\" refers on how easy it is to modify both codes and the electronics schematics from the documentation provided.\n\n\nFrom this point, Rhythm Open Badge developed in a manner that contributor would just need to download the Eagle Schematics and then try to fabricate that schematics.\n\n\nThis result on ....\n\n\nI think I need to determined my self here as a person who understand programming but not so much in electronics production.\n\n\nAnd programming is easier to learn than electronics due to portability and the risk of failure (money, time to spent to order the modules, as well as concern for tools depreciation).\n\n\nElectronics component is depreciate quickly over the recent years.\n\n\nElectronics component needs to be handled carefully.\n\n\nHence this project is set to be create another Sociometric Badge that is in higher level from the Rhythm Open Badge.\n\n\nThis project also wants to set a low risk - easy to setup example on how to develop an alternative to the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft paragraph.\n\n\nAside from the Sociometric Badge itself, the inspiration for this project is the Rhythm Open Badge. Rhythm Open Badge is an open source project under MIT License and has its repository hosted within GitHub (https://github.com/HumanDynamics/openbadge/). From its homepage (http://www.rhythm.mit.edu/open-badge/), this project offers solution to cheap and open alternative to help people with interaction studies. At some sense, most of it, Rhythm Open Badge is similar to the Sociometric Badge. Rhythm Open Badge project started on 21st January 2016. At the time this paper is written it is still under development. Hence, the documentation is not yet complete. From this point, one could make Rhythm Open Badge with downloading schematics, fabricate the board, and then attaching the electronic components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft paragraph.\n\n\nI identify myself as someone who do programming more than making electronics. My personal view is that doing and learning programming is more \"portable\" than learning and making electronics. Additionally, programming has little to no risk compared with making electronics. With recent days electronics devices get depreciated quickly, with new and better modules come every months, I want to set this project to make an alternative device to the Sociometric Badge that is in higher level than the Rhythm Open Badge and with low - risk, easy to make and modify approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"higher level\" refers to easier to interface for both maker and user.\n\n\nFinal chapter 1.\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge is a set of wearable social sensors developed by Boston based company named Humanyze.

After knowing what could be the possibilities, user groups will be determined. From this chapter, it is known that the primary user group will be the social scientists. However, there will be discussions on whom else could benefit from any informations come from this project. Next is about Limitations and Requirements. Limitations are defined as project and technical limitations. The purpose of Limitations and Requirements is to define Design Principles and Design Goals. Principle in general is used as a track, so the project will not go outside its context. The difference between Project Requirements and Design Goals is that Requirements are points that I need to do as the only doer of this project. Whereas Design Goals are objective that the deliverables from this project need to achieve. After all of these, there will be tests. The tests will be usability testing and implementation test. This paper then ended with Conclusion. In Conclusion, there will be Advices for future similar projects and Possible Implementations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the whole chapter 1.\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge is a set of wearable social sensors developed by Boston based company named Humanyze. It promises to optimize how people works in office environment. To achieve such goal, it works by constructing physical, real - life, social networks based from social interaction of its wearers. As the name and its goal suggest, social activity defined with multiple correspondents interchange informations both subtle and explicitly. Thus, Sociometric Badge cannot work on its own. The deal usually comes with a set of Sociometric Badges and its supporting environment (an application to extract data, as well as web client).\nAlthough, Sociometric Badge primarily intended to be used in office environment, there are requests come from social scientists as well. Traditionally, social scientists use interview, observation, and survey to get social data. In the recent day, there are technologies to leverage interview and survey. For example, with Skype people can conduct interview over the Internet and there are web based applications like Google Form or Survey Monkey to help people to make online survey. However, there are no latent technologies that can be used to help social observation just yet. Sociometric Badge can be the answer for such problem, as it can help social scientists to do social observation and give additional parameters to interview and survey.\nThe highlight of this project is about a misfit principle between social scientists and the Sociometric Badge itself. The Sociometric Badge started from a sequence of similar researches and products. The original inspiration was from 1992's Active Badge by Olivetti Research. Between Active Badge to the Sociometric Badge, there are others similar projects. These projects led into the development of the Sociometric Badge in 2008. However, after 2008, there are little to no information of the Sociometric Badge. Until, it then re - appeared as a commercial product. As the nature of common commercial products, the Sociometric Badge became a close - ended product. There are neither hardware and software development kit for the newest version of the Sociometric Badge. This is a bummer for the social scientists if modifications are necessary. Additionally, as the time this paper is written, the only way to buy the Sociometric Badge is with an email form in the bottom of the company's website (https://www.humanyze.com/contact.html). There is no obvious \"Buy Now\" button as it is usually in e - commerce based website. I tried to contact them to ask for informations regarding the Sociometric Badge, however there are no reply. These problems are what make the Sociometric Badge is not accessible to use for research purposes.\nAside from the Sociometric Badge itself, recently, there is Rhythm Open Badge. Rhythm Open Badge is an open source project with MIT License and has its repository hosted within GitHub (https://github.com/HumanDynamics/openbadge/). Known from its homepage (http://www.rhythm.mit.edu/open-badge/), this project offers cheap solution to help people with interaction studies. At some senses, most of it, Rhythm Open Badge is similar to the Sociometric Badge. Rhythm Open Badge project started on 21st January 2016. At the time this paper is written it is still under development. Hence, the documentation is not yet complete. From this point, one could make Rhythm Open Badge with downloading schematics, fabricating the board, attaching the electronic components, then uploading the codes.\nI define myself as someone who do programming more than making electronics. In my personal view doing and learning programming is more \"portable\" and has little to no risk compared to learning and making electronics. It is hard to make a choice on which electronics development kit to develop with, when there are many to choose, yet the differences are just pin layout and the programming. Additionally, in these recent days, electronics development kits depreciate faster than before due to new solutions come every months. Hence, I want to set this project to make an alternative device to the Sociometric Badge that is in higher level than the Rhythm Open Badge, with low - risk, easy to make and modify approaches and with more codes and less about electronics.\nOverall, this paper is about detailed progress on my attempt to create aforementioned device which is the alternative to the Sociometric Badge. This paper starts a chapter about previous projects and products as implementations. The idea of this chapter is to define what are the features for current iteration (the result from this project) and the features for future iterations. After knowing what could be the possibilities, user groups will be determined. From this chapter, it is known that the primary user group will be the social scientists. However, there will be discussions on whom else could benefit from any informations come from this project. Next is about Limitations and Requirements.

It uses blink signal from smart phone screen to send shake hand code into the Electric Imp.\n\n\nI think Ruby is the main programming language if you want to develop an IoT app with Electric Imp.\n\n\nI think this was made so that many DIY people could later use data analytics services provided from New Relic.\n\n\nIt has Android and iOS communication as it is default in Electric Imp.\n\n\nNew Relic Future Stack Badge has a near field communication or NFC as its main wireless connection to transfer data between other New Relic Future Stack Badge.\n\n\nNew Relic Future Stack Badge is used to exchange contact information when tapped together. This is done using NFC.\n\n\nNew relic Future Stack Badge was made to be hackable in the first place.\n\n\nNew Relic Future Stack Badge was programmed in Ruby.\n\n\nThis wearable is made with Electric Imp.\n\n\nThis wearable technology comes from a company named New Relic.\n\n\nData for State Of The Art.\n\n\nYear of origin: 2013.\n\n\nName: New Relic Future Stack Badge.\n\n\nType: Do it yourself.\n\n\nForm: Card.\n\n\nWireless connectivity: NFC and WiFi.\n\n\nDocumentation available: Codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks.\n\n\nhttps://blog.newrelic.com/2013/11/18/making-futurestack-badge/\n, first party article.

General conferences and events might be better to put money on the event itself rather than buying and using nTag.\n\n\nGenerally used as a tools to simplify logistics at large events and conference.\n\n\nIt uses RF to connect to local server. So, within a conference or an event there would be a statically placed computer that acts as a server to store data from RF in the nTag.\n\n\nnTag came as a product from a startup company from MIT Media Arts.\n\n\nnTag can be used to conduct real - time survey.\n\n\nnTag can be used to manage large flow of people within an event or conference.\n\n\nnTag could not be used by its own, but rather in package.\n\n\nnTag is priced around 30 USD to 90 USD.\n\n\nnTag is similar to Meme/Thinking Tag. I suggest that nTag is the realization of Meme/Thinking Tag.\n\n\nnTag new website is \nhttp://www.alliancetech.com/\n. However the company is not selling nTag anymore but more into general equipment for conference.\n\n\nnTag owned by the event organizer and should not be owned at personal level.\n\n\nnTag was intentionally as a commercial solution for event organizer to manage conference and event.\n\n\nThe nTag main website is a dud.\n\n\nThe personal intention is to make people to get into and join conversation easily.\n\n\nThe tag line is to enhance networking opportunities.\n\n\nThere is a real - time data management.\n\n\nThere is a tracking feature as well to detect which room is crowded and which room is not crowded.\n\n\nThere is no specific research paper that is about nTag.\n\n\nData for State Of The Art.\n\n\nYear of origin: 2004.\n\n\nName: nTag.\n\n\nType: Commercial.\n\n\nForm: Office badge.\n\n\nSense: Location.\n\n\nWireless communication: Infrared and RF.\n\n\nThere is no documentation as far as I know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks.\n\n\nhttp://florence20.typepad.com/renaissance/2008/10/the-smart-ntag-conference-badge.html\n, brief article about nTag.\n\n\nhttp://newatlas.com/go/2543/\n, nTag article from NewAtlas.\n\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030423005432/en/Interactive-Badge-Introduced-nTAG-Gatherings-Meetings-Quantum\n, an article about user case of nTag.\n\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ntag-interactive-badge-system-enhanced-learning-and-networking-opportunities-at-aspect-software-customer-conference-58169322.html\n, an article about nTag but this article sounds more scientific.\n\n\nhttp://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/ntag-conference-badges/\n, article about nTag.\n\n\nhttps://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2003/04/29/smart-conference-badges-ntag-is-an-mit-media-lab/\n, this article says that the nTag was from MIT Media Arts startup.

As general consumer device it was priced for 799 USD, although there were a point it reached 399 GBP, but it is still an expensive device.\n\n\nOMG Autographer uses 136 degree wide angle lens for its camera.\n\n\nThe company is, sadly, closed.\n\n\nThe intention was as a general lifelogging device.\n\n\nThe most packed version for general lifelogging device.\n\n\nThe thing that I personally like is that OMG Autographer has a LED matrices user interface that greet the user. So, the wearer and anyone can see if this device is currently recording.\n\n\nThere are at least 5 known sensors.\n\n\nThere are other implementation as well, like for example for people with neuro degenerative diseases like Alzheimer to help them to develop their surrogate memory.\n\n\nThere is a motion sensor for both user and surrounding.

But, from the website, it says that Rhythm Open Badge is able to detect audio, presence, and proximity. The 2 latter ones are with Bluetooth.\n\n\nI think Rhythm is the project name. Whereas Open Badge is the sub - project (the device name).\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge can be powered with a coin battery.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge has 2 versions.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge has limited amount of information aside from the website itself.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge intended to study human real - life interactivity.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge is the newest solution for open source Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge project is promoted (or supervised) from the same person that initiates Sociometric Badge (Prof. Alex \"Sandy\" Pentland).\n\n\nSadly, the term \"Open Badge\" contradicts with what it is available from Mozilla Foundation's web based Open Badge that is completely unrelated to Rhythm Open Badge. Hence, I refer this as Rhythm Open Badge.\n\n\nThe 1st version of Rhyhtm Open Badge is developed using RFDuino. An Arduino compatible development board.\n\n\nThe 3rd version of Rhythm Open Badge is developed using NRF51 - DK. A development kit with built - in BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).\n\n\nThe open-source hardware badges can be worn by participants around their necks or clipped to their clothing, and measures speaking activity and proximity to other badges.\n\n\nThe tutorial and the documentations are still incomplete.\n\n\nThe whole project is still ongoing.\n\n\nThere is a Google Hangout plug - in. However, Google Hangout is not available anymore.\n\n\nThere is a Python based server.\n\n\nThere is an Android application to test how Rhythm Open Badge works. However, the features is limited.\n\n\nThis project started on 21st January 2016.

There are two kinds of Arduino those I think would be a fit for this project: Arduino UNO and Arduino MEGA.\n\n\nMost of the time, for DIY electronics project, Arduino UNO is well enough. Personally, the reason to use the MEGA variant if the projects need more input and output pins as well as large on-board memory to store more codes.\n\n\nArduino UNO/MEGA offers a user friendly development approach. As it is a mature open source project, Arduino UNO/MEGA comes with a lot of options to extended for both codes and for the physical hardware. Hence, Arduino UNO/MEGA is commonly used as development platform to kick-start electronics project.\n\n\nArduino is the lowest entry point for electronics development platform. There are many kinds of Arduino.\n\n\nArduino UNO is one of the entry point when people usually start using Arduino.\n\n\nArduino MEGA goes next for people that needs to store more codes and to have many more in and out pins.\n\n\nArduino NANO variant is what people goes if smaller form is matter and foot print is not important. It serves the same specifications with Arduino UNO but nearly a fourth the size.\n\n\nIf footprints matter though, usually people (my friends) goes with dis-attaching the ATMega chip on the Arduino UNO and then re-create concise PCB.\n\n\nIn that case, schematics matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft, I assumed that this will be really bad. I write this in hurry.\n\n\nBased from my experience, trouble comes when the project started to get bigger. The use of third party library sometimes left unnecessary footprints. This causes the codes to take more spaces. On the other hand, Arduino especially the UNO variant has only 32 kilobytes to store codes, while the MEGA variant offers eight times more storage for codes than Arduino UNO. So, if Arduino project programmed with more than two libraries used, it might be good to start off using Arduino MEGA.\n\n\nFor this project, I tried to use Arduino UNO to make the first iteration. Making an independent wearable sensor device is not possible with Arduino since the lack of static storage (can be extended with SD Card reader but that significantly increases codes size) and processing power. The problem was realized when I need to take data from multiple sensors, filter the data, and send it to database with specific tagging. The tagging will be the an identification string and a real-world time stamp. This result in in multiple operations need to be done independently: time counter needs to be increased for every sample time passed in real-world (in this scenario it was a second), while keep waiting for data from sensor, as well as to sent data to database wireless.\n\n\nFor the timer I used the classic 555 timer chip to have the system take data regularly and to tag it with time stamp. There is other option that might a better fit for this situation, which is a real-world clock chip from Maxim Integrated. It has library for easy interface with Arduino as well.\n\n\nThe filter is very simple. In essence the system will not bother on very low value comes from the sensor. Since, raw sensor valued always from 0 to 1023, there is a necessity to convert the value into more human comprehensible value.\n\n\nWhen I was developing with Arduino I used ESP8266 to sent data to simple web server and then to database over WiFi. However there was a problem of which these operations are not in sync to each other. The case was, when timer is ready, it asks sensor to capture incoming input, if there is a connectivity delay from the ESP8266 the options are either to buffer the data or to discard the data before the database input. The latter is not preferable. The former made the buffer grow larges. Additionally, because data input to the database need to be confirmed back to each clients, the process sometimes took longer than the sample time, hence the sensors misses its interval to capture data.\n\n\nFrom my development time using Arduino. I concluded that for a project like this, where a lot of operations should happened independently to each other and not stacked together into a single thread, having access to multi-threaded programming can make the development process easier.\n\n\nI decided to re-make the whole application back with Raspberry PI. The use of full featured Linux operating system make the development process easier. One can just develop a Linux application and then run it in Raspberry PI without little to no adjustment necessary. Raspberry PI uses Python as a programming language to interface with its input and output pins. A fresh install of Raspbian Linux includes Python library to interface with hardware easily.\n\n\nMy approach was to program everything as possible without the Raspberry PI itself. Started to program face detection using OpenCV and then audio pitch and volume detection using Aubio and Alsa. All libraries have a Python wrapper. However, the use of Alsa to interface audio input is so specific to Linux. Hence, I decided to change Alsa with higher level library so the pitch and volume detection can be in other operating system as well. The replacement of Alsa is PyAudio, which is a very extensive library to interface audio input and output.\n\n\nAfter I done with programming for the multi-modal sensor, I went to establish database connection. There are a lot of choices for database. The obvious one is to use SQL based database. SQL is the latent database that most people know. However, as suggested in \n(please put reference from Carthal Gurrin paper here, I think he says something on why NOSQL database is better to use than using SQL variant)\n using SQL database for social data gathering limits the potential of adding additional information. Real-life social interactivity can be determined with less or more informations and not strictly to the amount that previously defined in the SQL scheme. This concept suggest me to use NOSQL database. Basically, NOSQL database is a recently popular variant of database that is not strict to a scheme. To some sense, NOSQL database is just a collection of documents formatted like JSON or Python's dict. There are two options I looked for this project's database: MongoDB and RethinkDB. I decided to use the latter because this project aims to have real-time information operation, of which what RethinkDB is promised. The nature of NOSQL database to be inputted arbitrarily benefit this project, since the data from sensor can be easily added or removed.\n\n\nThe web server done with Python's Flask. Flask is a minimal web library to establish web server a fast as possible. This project will not have a particular attention on developing web server itself. Since the web server is only used to let user to view what are inside the database (public API), a simple minimalistic library like Flask fits the needs. For web client I try to implement a visualization based on D3JS.\n\n\nThe latest programming I did before making the case was developing the context-given-agent. In this case I got myself two infrared LEDs and two infrared receiver. The circuitry is simple, each needs the infrared transceiver, a 10K Ohm resistor, and an NPN transistor. I used LIRC library to interface this self-made infrared transceiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hurdles was when transferring the whole codes into Raspbian, the Raspberry PI official operating system. To get access to hardware, correct permissions need to be given. This is common security measure for any operating systems. In Raspbian, there are two default users: root and pi. root has the privilege of being super user. Being super users allow all possible modifications to the operating system, this includes hardware access. The default pi user, on the other hand, has limited access, unless specific permission is given by \nsudo\n. \nsudo\n refers to \nsu\n and \ndo\n. It gives normal privileged user to execute command on behalf of super user. The development was not pleasant due to I did not know what is the best practices. Then, I decided to set and run the codes with super user privilege, hence giving all hardware access. This is not the ideal situation, since imposing an application with super user privilege is the same with letting anyone goes in and out through your house. However, I found that this practice is suitable for development purpose.uitable for development purpose.",

This is made for my next deliverable.\n\n\nDraft!!!!\n\n\nOn the recent days, technology advances in every second.\n\n\nOverall, this project is about my attempt on developing a wearable social sensor.\n\n\nFor that matter, there are a lot of development kit and programming frameworks to kick start the project.\n\n\nHowever, the situation would be different when this project finishes.\n\n\nWhen this project finishes, there could be a better development platform available.\n\n\nThat, or I could have just missed an available development tools those are fitter for this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft for next paragraph!!!!\n\n\nMy design principle is to have everything as portable as possible when I am not sure on what will be the hurdles later on.\n\n\n\"Portability\" refers to codes and electronics schematics that can be deployed in most development environment with little to change necessary.\n\n\nGenerally, for this project, this implies to choose a generally available development board for electronics as well as to use its accompanying programming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext paragraph draft!!!!\n\n\nThe ideal development board for this project will be a \"liberal\", programming language agnostic development kit.\n\n\nThe chosen board need to have a generous options for connectivity, decent amount of input and outputs pins, and will be better to have several supported programming language to be programmed with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft again :D.\n\n\nThe ideal programming language will be a programming language that is not strictly typed but also not too liberal. Since, I am the only developer for this project, if I expect for people to continue the project in the future, the codes must be cleanly typed, readable, and well structured. A liberal programming language with emphasize on flexible coding like JavaScript will not satisfy this requirement. This project needs to use a programming language that can enforce a good writing style to any programmers regardless their skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext paragraph is about my choice of database.\n\n\nThis project will use a hosted database service to store data. However, since I personally is not keen on database and its practices. The chosen database might not be specifically the best solution, but the most accessible for me to develop. This also means to have whichever database supported by a programming language from the chosen development board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParagraph on what makes this project is different than other lifelogging/real-life social data gathering project.\n\n\nFrom the previous chapter \n(please put reference to State of the Art chapter here)\n, there are no implementation that involves on real-time data gathering. Most of data are gathered seamlessly but the storing process is still done manually. It would be a good test for this project to implement real-life, real-time data gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is paragraph related to my technologies of choice.\n\n\nTo sum up, the choose of technologies will mainly revolve the development board. Nowadays, programming language can be compiled and wrapped into another programming language. An electronics development boards have options to be programmed in another programming language. Most of the time, electronics development kit comes in a specific framework for a programming language, unless there is a community needs on wrapping that framework into another programming language. This suggest on the availabilities for common development platforms like Arduino and RaspberryPI to be programmed in more than one programming languages. For this project, I will determine a programming language that well structured and enforce good writing. Then, I check if the aforementioned programming language supported with the development platform. If not, this project will use the first party framework from a programming language of which the development board designed to be developed with in the first place.ed with in the first place.",

            "text": "First paragraph draft for user groups.\n\n\nThere are two user groups or this project: social scientists and makers.\n\n\nSocial science defined as a study on how people behave. Social scientists usually work on formal activities to adjust and to predict what are the people reactions given a set of situations.\n\n\nMaker defined as someone who make technology, representing do-it-yourself (DIY) sub-culture.\n\n\nThis project wants to deliver an alternative to Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nThe social scientist sit as the end - user of that deliverable.\n\n\nThe makers, on the other hand, act as mediators between the possible unknown realm of hardware/software development to the social scientists.\n\n\nSince both groups can exists independently, a person could be determined as both social scientist and maker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond paragraph.\n\n\nThe term of maker will never have clear qualifications.\n\n\nIn ideal case, maker needs to be able to derive a fitting technological solution given the design goals and limitations.\n\n\nSince the design goals for this project will be related to social sciences, especially psychology, suitable maker for this project would be someone who has ever done works on interfacing social interaction into discrete world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird paragraph.\n\n\nTo make an alternative to Sociometric Badge, both groups need to communicate on the requirements and the limitations. In this project, social scientists need to determine the project requirements. While, makers need to determine what are the current technical limitations as well as their own limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst paragraph for explaining social scientists.\n\n\nThis project deals with technology that could leverage the work of social scientists.\n\n\nAs social science lives in different spectrum from common technological background, experiment with the use of technologies seems not quite nourished compared to other studies like design or business. This results as spaces for more specific technologies to fit in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond paragraph for social scientists.\n\n\nIn term of social data gathering, social scientists mainly use interview, observation, and questionnaire. For each of those, there are particular technologies that could be used to leverage the process. For example, Skype for interview and Survey Monkey for questionnaire. However, there are no tools that can be easily fit to leverage all together just yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird paragraph draft fr social scientists.\n\n\nThe concept of computer exists in anything (pervasive/ubiquitous computing) and Internet exists in everything (Internet of Thing) can be used to power up interview, observation, and questionnaire. There are good ingredients can be taken from those implementations listed in previous chapter \n(refer back to the previous chapter of State of the Art)\n. The obstacle will be to mix and match which components to use. Then, communicate the combinations to the makers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaker!\n\n\nAs it is defined in The New York Times, maker is a technology based sub \u2013 culture based on DIY culture. The sense of do\u2013it\u2013yourself is for one to be able to make something without professional experience and professional tools. For this project, looking for specific people that exactly has the knowledge of embedded device and programming is not easy. However, there are a lot of hobbyists that could achieve to make the same thing for lower entry technical project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maker tasked to define limitations, design the technical approach to solve the problem, and to document process for further iterations. Makers need to understand what is the commonly used tools. And then use this tool to develop the solution. Since this project has high regard on the flexibility of the resultant device, documentations are necessary in case minor modifications are required.modifications are required.",

            "text": "Draft about tool of choice.\n\n\nThoughts....\n\n\nThe controller is an electronics development kit used to develop deliverable for this project.\n\n\nThe ideal development board for this project will be a \"liberal\", programming language agnostic development kit.\n\n\nThe chosen board need to have a generous options for connectivity, decent amount of input and outputs pins, and will be better to have several supported programming language to be programmed with.\n\n\nRequirements.\n\n\nWhat are the requirements when choosing electronics development platform.\n\n\nNot to be strict on these requirements, however it is good to have the electronics development kit those are these.\n\n\nOpen source.\n\n\nPopular.\n\n\nCommon.\n\n\nEasy to get.\n\n\nA lot of wireless connectivity options.\n\n\nA lot of plug-and-play plug-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft on paragraph.\n\n\nThere are some requirements I put, those I used when choosing the correct electronics development platform. These requirements are flexible.\n\n\nThere are some guidelines I put when I needed to choose proper electronics development platform. These guidelines are flexible and not strictly to be followed.\n\n\nIn this case would be good to have an open source electronics development platform. What does open source means for electronics development platform? Open source refers to decentralized project management. The project is free to copy and free to modify for all. Usually it has specific people to manage the main project. This culture allows anyone to contribute to the project by forking/branching the project and then make their own changes, before finally push the changes back into the repository. Anyone could ask for \"pulling\" to other branch owner to merge their changes together. The whole operations results on faster development time and bug fixing, since adjustment can be done from anyone. Having open source hardware means that if adjustment happen, oneself or anyone who has the knowledge could do the modifications, without waiting the first party to do the action. The power of open source project itself lies on the community.\n\n\nHaving a popular electronics development platform would be a good choice. However, the term popularity, like which one is more popular from other, is subjectively given. Hence, the term of popularity here means on how accessible and responsive the community around chosen electronics development platform. Not all open source project are healthy. All of them usually start low profile and without expectation. A newly set open source project usually have its focus on development itself rather than adding features or bug fixing (yet, alone documentation). Hence, to chose solely because the electronics development board is open source not always the best solution. The first thing, I personally always check is where I would ask for questions. There are a lot of communication channels for developer. Ranging from the casual Reddit, Slack, the more formal StackOverflow, into the ancient IRC. Sometimes a channel is more active than another. Thus, the idea of searching for a popular electronics development platform is to determine how fast a question can be answered with little to no cost.\n\n\nThe ideal situation is that, one can get an electronics development platform as fast as possible from nearby local or online store. Although, commercial products could have the same qualities as well, this again suggest an advantage for an open source project. Overall, this quality will determined on the distribution of electronics development platform. Open source hardware that has its blueprints easily accessed can cloned. So, although the cloned hardware is not necessarily to be the exact same from the first party distributions, the ideal cloned hardware can still gives the same features with faster time to get into the developer.\n\n\nPersonally, to determine which electronics development platform to use, I will look on how many wireless communication can be easily interfaced. This implies on the hardware modularity as well as the necessary programming library of the chosen electronics development platform. As it was mentioned before, wearable devices most of the time need to either work independently or to have at least a method of wireless communication, since hardware-wise they are not powerful. Regardless, whether I chose to make an independent wearable device or dependent wearable device with wireless connectivities, it is better to have more options for wireless communication for development purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not keen on developing electronics from scratch. Hence, this comes as my personal limitation. The ideal solution is to get pre-made plug-in that can be just plugged-in and be programmed. In Arduino the term used is \"shield\", whereas Raspberry PI refers the same mechanics as \"hat\". Both shield and hat make use of the input and output pins to give functionalities for the development platform.the development platform.",

Since every thought had gone in and out from the Humanyze's Sociometric Badge even before any formalities happened, I set the badge as the main reference point for this project.\n\n\nI want the next paragraph(s) to define what this project is looking for. Perhaps, accessing every possible terms semantically.\n\n\nPrototype.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is a wearable set of sensors to detect and process social signals.\n\n\nSemantically, Sociometric Badge is a wearable badge - like device to detect and process incoming social signal.\n\n\nHowever, nowadays the term of social signal is anything refer to activities from Internet social networking (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), whereas Sociometric Badge meant for real - life social signal.\n\n\nThe flow is to get real - life social data from the continuous world and process it with computer to make sense of the data received.\n\n\nThis means the obvious needs of sensors.\n\n\nFurthermore, as suggested by Carthal Gurrin in \n(please put reference here to the general paper about lifelogging)\n, social data needs to be taken ambiently to preserve its naturality.\n\n\nHence, for this project to make an alternative to Sociometric Badge, form is matter.\n\n\nAnd by defining Sociometric Badge as a wearable technology, any related devices need to work as independently as possible or to have at least a form of wireless communication.\n\n\nInternally, there are three qualities those need to be looked into when looking for related devices to Sociometric Badge: the sensor, the form, and either the independence or the form of wireless communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had these sentences before, but I think I will separate these into another paragraph.\n\n\nAs from my side, personally, I will look into inspirations that I can learn from.\n\n\nTo deduct myself what are the proper things to do for this project, the availability of documentations are good to have although not necessary.\n\n\nIt is hard to get internal information for commercial device, hence based on the availability of informations I give three classifications based on the device's project type: commercial, do it yourself, and research.\n\n\nSadly, it is hard to get internal information for commercial device.\n\n\nHowever, despite how hard it is to get internal information for commercial devices, each of them is happened to be a shipshape and an appropriate product.\n\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, there are many do it yourself electronics badges that usually focused on their easiness to be made and modified.\n\n\nBoth areas could be exists within a specific research that had previously done.\n\n\nHence, based on the availability of informations I give three classifications based on the device's project type: commercial, do it yourself, and research.\n\n\nAnd for the kind of informations, I will look for any documentations those are made by each first parties of each respective inspirational devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth paragraphs.\n\n\nSemantically, Sociometric Badge is a wearable badge - like device to detect and process incoming social signal. The problem is that nowadays the term of \"social signal\" mislead into anything that refer to activities in Internet social networking (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), whereas Sociometric Badge is meant for real - life social activities. The flow is to get real - life social data from the continuous world and process it with computer to make sense of the data received. This means the obvious needs of sensors, specifically sensors to take real-life social data. Furthermore, as suggested by Carthal Gurrin in \n(insert book name, author name, page, APA, MLA, ... here)\n, social data needs to be taken ambiently to preserve its naturality. Thus, for this project to make an alternative to Sociometric Badge, the form is matter and it should not be intrusive to be worn and to be seen. And by defining Sociometric Badge as a wearable technology, any related devices need to work as independently as possible or to have at least a form of wireless communication. Internally there are three qualities those need to be looked into when looking for related inspirational devices to Sociometric Badge: the sensor, the physical form, and either the independence of the device or the form of wireless communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs from my side, personally, I will look into inspirations those I can learn from. To deduct by myself what are the proper things to do for this project, although are not necessary, the availability of documentations are good to have. Sadly, it is hard to get internal information for commercial devices. However, despite how hard it is to get internal informations for commercial devices, each of them is happened to be a shipshape and an appropriate product to learn from. On the other side of the spectrum, there are many do it yourself (DIY) electronics badge projects those are usually focused on their easiness to be made and modified. These DIY projects fit with this project low - risk, small commitment principles. Both spectrum could exists within a specific research that had previously been done. So, based on the availability of informations I give three classifications based on the device's project type: commercial, do it yourself, and research. And for the kind of informations, I will look for any documentations those are made by each first parties of every respective inspirational devices, these usually related to source codes and schematics.ective inspirational devices, these usually related to source codes and schematics.",

These are all about electronics and software aside from the research paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is about sensor and multi-modal sensors.\n\n\nInsert quotation from Prelude To The Foundation here.\n\n\nIn this project, I see that there are two classifications for sensor.\n\n\nThere are traditional sensors like photo resistor that at most can only measure light intensity.\n\n\nThere are multi-modal sensors as well.\n\n\nMulti-modal sensors usually offers more than one measurement.\n\n\nAnd the result from multi-modal sensor could be both qualitative and quantitative data.\n\n\nExamples of multi-modal sensors are things like audio recorder and video camera.\n\n\nThere are a lot of features that can be extracted from audio or video.\n\n\nFor example pitch and volume can be inferred from incoming audio, while from video light intensity and motion can be detected.\n\n\nTo get the quantitative aspect from these sensor, additional layer of processing is necessary.\n\n\nMost of the time these are done at software level, for instance the usage of computer vision framework like OpenCV to do image processing.\n\n\nAlthough the multi-modal sensors are very flexible, they have a lot of foot prints. Audio and video files take thousands bytes compared to data from traditional sensors that (usually an integer) only takes 8 bytes in 64 bits system. And not all available informations from those audios or videos will be used. As inferred from the development of Sociometric Badge \n(insert reference from the Sociometric Badge main research paper)\n, the data produced from multi-modal sensor can be further dumbed down in size, thus only necessary informations are saved. However, this means there will be system that has fast enough enough processing power and plenty of volatile memories. These are not the qualities of wearable devices, since even flag ship smart phones will have difficulties to extract data from audio and videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two solutions for managing data from multi-modal sensor: to store the data as it is or to strip the multi-modal sensor data during the run-time. The former requires big static memories, while the latter needs faster CPU and more RAM. From this table it is known that at least XX bytes are necessary to store data per day \n(insert table from the general lifelogging paper, the table that shows on how big data will produced annually from a lifelogging activities)\n. To put into perspective, a multi-modal only social device like Memoto/Narrative Clip offers 8 gigabytes on board memory, however it received the incoming data as it is without any further operation.ut any further operation.",

            "text": "For the kind of projects there some intersections between DIY project and research project as well as commercial project and research project.\n\n\nIt is understandable why there are no intersection on commercial and DIY project.\n\n\nFor any projects those are related to interactivity and human interaction, it seems that most of these implementations have a sense for location.\n\n\nLocation can be both global positioning system from GPS or local positioning system that can be simple as to mention on which room the user is in.\n\n\nAS previously mentioned, wireless communication is not mandatory unless the implementation can work independently.\n\n\nHowever, implementations about interactivity cannot work independently as it needs counter measure from similar device. For these device the minimum wireless communication will be infrared that transfer identification codes to other devices.\n\n\nWhat I want to say here?\n\n\nI think I would just infer directly from the table....\n\n\nBut that might be too long.\n\n\nBy looking from the table, it seems that every social related devices need to have context. Any ....\n\n\nI suggest that there are two layers of results come from socially aware devices. The first layer is the raw sensor data from the device itself. However, just sole numbers are not enough for human comprehension, context needs to be given. This present the second layer of the results, of which context agent will take role on determining context on each numbers. Context agent gives meaning to the numbers. For example, there is a fitness tracking device that measures the speed of its wearer. It shows information on how fast the wearer runs. However, for social data gathering the numbers does not mean anything. There are unlimited of possible contexts. For an instance, whether the wearer was running as their daily routine or running to chase departing train from the station. Usually, common fitness tracking uses internal or smart phone GPS to determine where the user was running. If it detected acceleration and the wearer was nearby train station, the latter context can be assumed.\n\n\nUsually context agent comes as a qualitative data (boolean, ID, or local position system). From the implementations listed in the table \n(please put reference from the State of the Art table)\n position and presence are meant as a context given agent. However, quantity data like global positioning system can define context as well. Nowadays machine learning can be leveraged as a context agent to detect patterns and then give meaning to the raw sensor data \n(please put reference here from the main paper of Sociometer and Sociometric Badge)\n. However, for smaller data set, context can be manually given by human as well. Finally, after both layers are identified, conclusion can be pulled. be pulled.",

            "text": "Active Badge.\n\n\nThe Active is a smart office badge for location tagging from 1992.\n\n\nAlthough the research project for this badge started on 1989, the device itself started to appeared around 1992.\n\n\nThe University of Twente Computer Science department is listed as one of the recipient for the first batch of the Active Badge.\n\n\nAside from Active Badges those appeared in research institution, this badge was used and originally purposed for office environment.\n\n\nIt has simple infrared location tagging for its wearer to access rooms within the office building.\n\n\nActive Badge declined in use when mobile phone and world wide web became more accessible to people.\n\n\nActive Badge is a smart office badge for location tagging appeared in 1992. The research for this badge started on 1989. The University of Twente Computer Science department is listed as one of the recipient for the first batch of the Active Badge. Aside from Active Badges those appeared in research institution, this badge was used and originally purposed for office environment. It has simple infrared location tagging for its wearer to access rooms within the office building. Active Badge declined in use when mobile phone and world wide web became more accessible to people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeme/Thinking Tag.\n\n\nThe project was first started as Meme Tag and then named into Thinking Tag. Back then, the idea of \"meme\" still came from the original Richard Dawkin's meme \n(reference to Richard Dawkins book about meme)\n which is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. And Meme Tag stands still on that definition. At its first usage, user needs to go to a computer booth to set their personal message (hence, meme). When there are other Meme Tag wearers, users can both point the infrared transceiver to each others for exchanging memes. It was used at event where there are a lot of people (usually conference). In the recent days, I see that Twitter took this same principle and add \"Internet\" into it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft SenseCam/Vicon Revue.\n\n\nMicrosoft SenseCam was a project at Microsoft Research but then carried out by a promising imaging company named Vicon. It changed name from Microsoft SenseCam into Vicon Revue and it became commercial product with price tag around 800 USD. There were ten years from Microsoft to Vicon. During those ten years a lot of researches happened ranging from health care (aiding people with Alzheimer) into Microsoft SenseCam as personal use. The initial use was actually to present Microsoft SenseCam as a wearable \"human blackbox\" as it records any possible interactions from its wearer point of view. Although it has no wireless communication, as the price and intention suggest, Microsoft SenseCam/Vicon Revue is packed with a lot of sensors and can be operated independently.\n\n\nInitiated in 2001, Microsoft SenseCam has its first prototype done with PIC micro controller. In my opinion, PIC was equivalent to what Arduino serves nowadays, an easy to interface development kit for electronics development. This suggest that device as extensive and as features packed like Microsoft SenseCam could be started with a humble electronics development kit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometer.\n\n\nFrom the name and features, I suggest that Sociometric Badge was a follow up project from Sociometer. Sociometric Badge has everything more than what Sociometer has. However, the intention is different as Sociometer is meant to be used for longer period of time. This makes significant decision on the form. Sociometric Badge is an entirety of normal office badge packed with sensory features. Sociometer, in the other hand, is designed to be as ergonomics as possible with its shoulder pad look. The decision was \n(insert reference to Sociometer main paper here)\n because of the needs to be worn all - day the device need to be as comfortable as possible. The cue is that the wearers will not feel like they are wearing Sociometer. As previously mentioned on how device with intention like Sociometer needs to be ambient, Sociometer's shoulder pad design suggest a new perspective on pervasive computing. As the computer unit is not hidden to the surrounding but is hidden for the main user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbER Badge.\n\n\nUbER Badge came from the same person who then decide to make Spinner \n(insert reference to Spinner main research paper here)\n as, perhaps, a follow up project to UbER Badge. The idea of UbER Badge roots in DIY principles as there are a lot of documentations available for commonalities to make UbER Badge for themselves. UbER Badge aims to aid researcher on studying human interaction. UbER Badge itself is very flexible to develop. There are many ways to adjust UbER Badge based on needs. Wholly, the later Rhythm Open Badge also seems very similar to UbEr Badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnTag.\n\n\nnTag is perhaps the commercial solution that is similar to Meme/Thinking Tag. The main feature is to share messages and preferences to other wearers, thus makes networking and starting conversation in conference easier. Additionally, there are a lot of features for the event organizer, for example to manage logistic and on - badge questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVocera Communication Badge.\n\n\nVocera Communication Badge is a commercially available wearable communication device for critical environment. Its demands, most of the time, come from hospitals for their need of communication devices for emergency situation. Vocera itself offers rugged Android phone with the same intention as an alternative to the badge. The use of RF and WiFi as its wireless communications suggest that those are reliable wireless communications as communication needs to be always available. Vocera Communication Badge costs around 20.000 USD for 75 users, with inclusive supporting system. Thus, this is not a personally owned device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSociometric Badge.\n\n\nSociometric Badge initially appeared in 2008 as a research project. It promised as a set of wearable sensor to enhance people interactivity.\n\n\nSociometric Badge went commercial.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is under a company named Humanyze.\n\n\nI think, Sociometric Badge is not part of the deal itself. But when you bought Sociometric Badge, you purchase for the whole environment.\n\n\nThere is a web client for administration panel. These administration panel is meant for both the wearer and the super user that can manage and set for the whole environment of Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is a closed environment. You cannot use Sociometric Badge on its own.\n\n\nSociometric Badge is intended to be used in corporate office environment.\n\n\nI refer this as a lifelogging solution for corporate and business. However, do not put pressure on lifelogging since that will be mentioned later.\n\n\nIt uses infrared to detect face to face conversation detection.\n\n\nThe latest research project that experiment to make a wearable set of social sensors.\n\n\nThe research of Sociometric Badge was published on 2008 \n(put reference from the Sociometric Badge main research paper here)\n. It is still the latest research project that has intention to make a wearable set of social sensors. After the aforementioned research, around 2011, there are little to no publication on what was the development status of Sociometric Badge. Until finally, it reappeared back commercially under company named Humanyze.\n\n\nI infer Sociometric Badge as a corporate lifelogging implementation or as a FitBit for personal development \n(put referene to an article that says that Sociometric Badge is like FitBit but for personal development)\n. Sociometric Badge promises to enhance people collaboration especially in corporate setup. It works in pre-determined environment along with other Sociometric Badges. It able to detect if there are abnormalities during conversation/interaction. Additionally, Sociometric Badge comes with a client interface for its wearer to see every data have ever recorded from the Sociometric Badge. From there the users could infer by themselves at which part of interaction they are lacking or if they overdo it. Fortunately the process does not happen automatically, users need to submit and move the data from their Sociometric Badge to main computer to see what Sociometric Badge records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut below paragraph in a section about sensors.\n\n\nI suggest that there are two layers of results come from Sociometric Badge. The first layer is the raw sensor data from Sociometric Badge. However, just sole numbers are not enough for human comprehension, context needs to be given. This present the second layer of the results. The users can either input results from the first layer result into Sociometric Badge content management system or give the context by themselves manually. After both layers identified, conclusion can be pulled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinner.\n\n\nSpinner came from the same creator that made UbER Badge.\n\n\nThe main intention of Spinner is for entertainment.\n\n\nSpecifically an automated entertainment.\n\n\nSpecifically an automated video log.\n\n\nThe sensor located statically in place.\n\n\nHence, Spinner only works in a pre - determined space.\n\n\nContrary to Microsoft SenseCam/Vicon Revue and Memoto/Narrative Clip, spinner takes 3rd person video for its users, since the video sensor is placed statically, instead of being worn.\n\n\nSpinner is formed as wrist watch and those statically placed sensor.\n\n\nThe Wristwatch is a set of sensors and wireless communication protocol by itself.\n\n\nThe wristwatch contains RF to communicate (it acts as presence detection as well) to the sensor nodes and accelerometer for motion detection.\n\n\nBasically a lifelogging implementation from 3rd person point of view.\n\n\nSpinner is a lifelogging implementation with third person point of view. It is intended to help people to make an automated video log with little to no manual editing. The result of Spinner is a video that display the life of the wearer from third person perspective, adjusted as such it is similar to a pre - determined pattern. The pattern can be chosen from pre - made patterns, made from scratch, or combination of both. Most of available pre - made patterns are based on popular movies like Star Wars. The resultant video expected to have the same flow with the provided pattern. I think the pattern is a set of predetermined sensory values that, if the condition meet, makes the statically placed camera node to start recording videos. After some times, it starts to compose videos for specific user based on user's available video clips and the provided pattern.\n\n\nIt has two things: the wearable sensors device with wristwatch like form and statically placed sensors node. The wearable sensors node uses RF to communicate to the static node to inform if it needs to capture data from the users. At bare minimum there are a sensor attached into the wristwatch and a video camera in the static node. In this case, it has motion detection to reference back with the previously provided pattern.\n\n\nSpinner ecosystem is a good example of social data gathering from third person point of view. This suggest less technical requirements on the moving, wearable sensory unit and more requirements into the statically placed sensory nodes. As previously mentioned, social data gathering needs \n(refer to the paper from Carthal Gurrin)\n to be ambient and form is matter, there might be technical requirements for putting larger or more sensors that make the wearable device become more intrusive and obvious to see. The solution is to leverage the environment itself as a host for sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemoto/Narrative Clip.\n\n\nThis started as a KickStarter campaign with a product named Memoto.\n\n\nHowever, the first commercial iteration came out as Narrative Clip.\n\n\nAs I want to love this device, it is just a glorified camera with attached accelerometer to register tapping as a way to physically interface with the device.\n\n\nIt has no button.\n\n\nIt automatically turned on if there is power and the camera is not covered up.\n\n\nTo turn off just put this in your pocket where it receives no light.\n\n\nThe advantage of using Narrative Clip is that the photo/video is taken automatically.\n\n\nAt default you could tap twice on the device to capture 10 seconds video (Narrative Clip 2 only).\n\n\nMemoto/Narrative Clip is the closest dedicated lifelogging implementation to consumer. It priced around 299 USD for the latest version and 150 for the first version. The price is three times cheaper than other consumer lifelogging device (Vicon Revue and OMG Autographer). It appeared in a featured KickStarter campaign for a product named Memoto in 2012, before it changed name into Narrative Clip. Narrative Clip is a dedicated lifelogging device. It has a camera, accelerometer, and a precisely small form. It has no buttons and interactions happen from gesture input received by the accelerometer. The whole system (device with its supporting software) provides easy tagging system to manage photos and videos from the device itself.\n\n\nNarrative Clip suggest the use of camera as a multi - modal sensor for self - social data gathering. The presents of camera means that there is no need to have another sensor since everything can be inferred from photos or videos. The lack of qualitative sensor values, however, suggests that the usage of Narrative Clip for real life social data gathering requires context given manually by human.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG Autographer.\n\n\nOMG Autographer appeared nearly in the same time with Memoto/Narrative Clip.\n\n\nOMG Autographer is a consumer level dedicated lifelogging application that share a lot similarities with then discontinued Vicon Revue.\n\n\nI see OMG Autographer as smarter version of Memoto/Narrative Clip.\n\n\nIt has more sensors and hence more features.\n\n\nIt priced around 800 USD of which makes this device less accessible especially as a device for very specific need.\n\n\nOMG Autographer captures photo or video automatically based on its sensor data. To some sense this is similar to what Spinner achieved, but it has no limitation on where the user location.\n\n\nThere is a problem with Narrative Clip that OMG Autographer solved. Due to its small form factor of Narrative Clip, people surrounding its user usually complain if they know they are being monitored. There is no such problem as OMG Autographer has an obvious camera form.\n\n\nOMG Autographer is another consumer level lifelogging implementation derived from the discontinued Vicon Revue. It appeared in the same year with Memoto's KickStarter campaign, although sadly both the company and the product itself are discontinued. What set OMG Autographer from Memoto/Narrative Clip are price and features. OMG Autographer priced around 800 USD, and with very specific purpose it serves makes this device to be less accessible for general consumers. However, it has more features packed than Memoto/Narrative Clip. It has a built - in GPS and magneto meter to detect the orientation and where the camera is facing. OMG Autographer will manually take pictures based on input from sensors. To some sense this is what Spinner achieved without Spinner's limitation on pre - defined environment. For these qualities, I define OMG Autographer as a smarter version of Narrative Clip.\n\n\nThere is problem with Narrative Clip that OMG Autographer solved. Based on reviews from many consumer tech website, many Narrative Clip users comment on complains they received from people around them. The complain started when these surrounding people become aware of them being monitored by Narrative Clip. However, there is no such remarks on OMG Autographer. The hint could be on the obviousness of the camera. In Narrative Clip the camera design is very low profile and barely noticeable. On the the hand, OMG Autographer uses more obvious looking camera. From this notion I suggest people would not mind to be recorded if they are aware in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Relic Future Stack Badge.\n\n\nNew Relic is a company specialized in data analysis.\n\n\nThe Future Stack Badge is their DIY proof of concept solution that was used in their first - ever conference.\n\n\nWhat is interesting from the New Relic Future Stack badge is its less electronics development.\n\n\nIt was made with help of Electric Imp.\n\n\nElectric Imp is a small formed development kit to help all hardware to be connected into the Internet.\n\n\nElectric Imp can be easily interfaced with high level programming language like Ruby.\n\n\nBased from an article \n(insert article about the development of New Relic Future Stack Badge)\n the main developer has a good reason on why they were developing New Relic Future Stack Badge instead of using the widely available processing power from smart phone.\n\n\nThe key point here is because homogeneity.\n\n\nSmart phones have varied features, for example Apple refused to have NFC until iPhone 6. At that point other flagship Android smart phones have already shipped with NFC. Hence, making a sensor application in a heterogeneous platforms become harder. In this case, their solution was to develop a homogeneous hardware with easy to interface development kit to serve very specific need for their first ever New Relic conference. Additionally, socially speaking most people would rather not to install an application for only specific amount of time.\n\n\nNew Relic is a company specialized in data analysis. The Future Stack Badge is their DIY proof of concept solution that was used in their first - ever conference. It formed as a normal conference badge with additional feature to exchange contact with tapping it into another Future Stack Badge. It was made with help of Electric Imp. Electric Imp is a small formed development kit to help hardware to be connected to the Internet.\n\n\nBased from an article \n(put reference to the New Relic article that says something on why the development was started as a dedicated device instead of using smart phone)\n the main developer has a good reason on why they were developing New Relic Future Stack Badge instead of using the widely available processing power from smart phone. The main reason is because homogeneity. Smart phones have varied features, for example Apple refused to have NFC until iPhone 6. Whereas at that point other flagship Android smart phones had already shipped with NFC. Hence, making a sensory kind of application for smart phone become harder. Their answer was to develop a homogeneous hardware with easy to interface development kit to serve very specific need for their first - ever New Relic conference. Additionally, socially speaking most people would rather not to install an application for only specific amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFCON Unofficial AND!XOR Badge.\n\n\nDEFCON Unofficial AND!XOR Badge was a DIY badge made for 2016's DEFCON. DEFCON itself is a conference for people with interest in cyber security. Its general intention is just for fun, it has built - in puzzle to solve as well as chat application. However, there are features that would be good to be implemented in Sociometric Badge: the possibility of serial communication let this badge to be easily set with a common terminal application via USB and having LCD interface and buttons let its users to easily adjust settings without accessing computer. The former would make batch set up to be easier, whereas the later will be good to have in more research environment in case little adjustments are necessary.\n\n\nIt uses NRF development kit, that features low powered Bluetooth communication. Perhaps, DEFCON Unofficial AND!XOR Badge made with the same NRF development kit variant used to develop Rhyhtm Open Badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHackaday Belgrade/Supercon Badge.\n\n\nHackaday Belgrade/Supercon Badge came with more and less features than DEFCON Unofficial AND!XOR Badge. It is the featured badge for Hackaday conference. Although there is no tutorial to built one, there is a software development kit framework and guide to let its users develop application for this Hackaday Belgrade/Supercon Badge. Most of the time, applications on embedded wearable device are dead fixed unless there are hardware modifications or new codes upload to the micro controller. From implementations discussed in this chapter, only Hackaday Belgrade/Supercon Badge offers a way to develop applications for itself without hardware modifications and new codes upload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQueercon Badge.\n\n\nQueercon Badge is the main conference badge for 2016 Queercon. It is visually attractive and socially aware. Queercon Badge as RGB LEDs that react based on the color set from nearby badge. So the color on the LED will depend on the color of surrounding badge. This happened with help of hopping RF communication through all possible Queercon Badge in range. If Hackaday Belgrade/Supercon Badge offers a way to develop an application, there are some in and out pins to let users to extend this badge with, perhaps, additional LEDs or sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge.\n\n\nRhythm Open Badge is an open source implementation since Sociometric Badge went commercial. The project started in 21st January 2016 and still going. It is intended to help people to study human interaction. Although, open source and has its own GitHub hosted repository, due to still in development it lacks a lot information. There are three iterations done. The first one was done with Arduino compatible development kit, while the third one was done with NRF51 - DK BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) based micro controller from Nordic Semiconductor. There is no information on what is the intermediate iteration. Rhythm Open Badge can be powered with a coin battery. This project and DEFCON Unofficial AND!XOR Badge give the importance of having low powered wireless communication like BLE for wearable Internet of Things project.e of having low powered wireless communication like BLE for wearable Internet of Things project.",

The most important things are database server and physical client/mobile application client. These define the minimal requirement.\n\n\nThe physical client refer to the software development that connects every hardwares mentioned on physical computer requirement \n(refer back to the previously written paragraph about hardware requirements. I think, I titled it as Physical Computing)\n.\n\n\nThe mobile application refers to the development of mobile application as the alternative of Sociometric Badge itself. Although, the developer of Future Stack Badge said that the problem lies in the heterogeneity of smart phone on-board sensors. But at least basic functionality multi-modal data gathering like audio and video can still be accessed. The other counter point raised from Carthal Gurrin \n(reference to general paper about lifelogging)\n that form is matter and social data gathering should be not intrusive. Having form as a smart phone gives different meaning on the device, despite it meant to behave like Sociometric Badge. For testing this should not be matter. However, if the research respondents are not tech aware (for example, kindergarten children, people with neurodegenerative diseases, ...) having proper form is important, since smart phone lost its context as a real-life social data gathering tool. This why the use of smart phone as an alternative itself is discouraged.\n\n\nThe database server need not to be a self-hosted database per see. It can also be an embedded one. In general this more refer on the mechanism on where and how the data is stored. At minimal embedded database can formatted as .JSON, .XML, or just a bare .txt without specific format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe realistic approach is to develop: physical client, web client, web server, and database server. The physical client is the main deliverable for this project. Web server acts as a mediator between web client as well as to interface database server. The importance of web client lies on the necessity to present data from database in higher level. in higher level.",

This refer for a deliverable to be as ideal as possible, disregarding limit on money, knowledge, and time available. The idea is here is to know all the possibilities. Hence, the this ideal solution can be further dumbed down into more down-to-earth solution.\n\n\nThe minimal requirement refers to a minimal deliverable to test functionalities of the overall deliverable. The key is to make thing that is just barely testable. The goal is to set a stepping stone to develop the realistic requirement.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to define and build realistic requirement. The upper ceiling point was set by previously defined ideal requirements. And, the entry point was set by defining minimal requirement. The process started defining the ceiling point that can be further dumbed down, while practically making the from ground up. The result from the process is the realistic requirement.\n\n\nThe physical computing, as I previously defined in \n(please reference to State of the Art here!)\n, will mostly deal with which sensors to use.\n\n\nThe ideal case scenario is to implement all known sensors have ever used for social data gathering. This notion and this project intention to make the alternative to Sociometric Badge with experiment and research in mind, suggest that the device needs to be easily extended and reduced as well. Hence, it can afford to be extended by various sensors those have not yet defined as useful for taking incoming social signal. In term of hardware flexibility, previously mentioned Queercon Badge offers two input and output socket in its uppermost section. These let its users extend the physical capability of Queercon Badge.\n\n\nThe minimal scenario is just to implement a multi-modal sensor to the alternative of Sociometric Badge this project is trying to make. The example of concise device that only use a multi-modal sensor is Memoto/Narrative Clip. It only have a camera to take both photos and videos. However, data comes from photos or videos is very rich. Thus, there are a lot of things can be used to interpret for social scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom both cases, the realistic approach is to keep using one multi-modal sensor and use specific context-given sensors. From the previous chapter \n(please reference the previous chapter about State of the Art)\n, the latent context-given agent are either location, presence, machine learning, or manually given by human. Since I have no experience on machine learning, this makes only three options left. However, manually given context by human is not scalable. With increasing respondents, the amount of works will be increased exponentially. So, the options left in presence and location. Conveniently, both can be done with identification from infrared transceivers between devices. However, if I would choose which one is the more important, that will be presence detection. With ability to identify who is facing/around the user give more dimension for social experiment that related to real-life interactivity.e interactivity.",

Specifically, Sociometric Badge is a interactivity measuring device with more intention for corporate uses. This notion suggests that every general lifelogging implementations can be used as an alternative to the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nBut what are the catches? What makes general lifelogging appliances are different than things similar to Sociometric Badge? General lifelogging devices are meant for end - consumers. Hence, the resultant data need to be easily comprehended by human being regardless of the intelligence. Additionally, these kind of devices should be able to be used wherever, whenever its users want to. These reasons imply the use general capture module like audio recorder or video camera, as the outputs are rich in context and can be easily understandable. However, audio and video present large and unnecessary informations for specific device like Sociometric Badge. The use of more specific sensors can be seen in these specific devices and less in general lifelogging devices. Additionally, unlike general lifelogging device, Sociometric Badge can only be active in specific environment to limit its context. It will not work on itself as it needs to have others Sociometric Badges present for data to be compared.\n\n\nOverall, the differences between general lifelogging and devices like Sociometric Badge lies on the limitation and data interface. lifelogging application need to be understood by many spectrum of people. On the other hand, devices similar to the Sociometric Badge limit themselves to a certain group of people. The data can be interfaced and shrunk down based on that specific group of people. Also, Sociometric Badge and its predecessors can only be used under specific conditions. For example, Sociometric Badge can only be used within an office building with other similar devices active. Although, general lifelogging device can be used for the same situation as well, the conveniences and practicalities to enforce those specific conditions are not there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below \n(please put reference to the State of the Art table)\n presents both general and specific lifelogging implementations. The specific lifelogging implementations are ones those are related to human interaction. Aside from lifelogging appliances, due to lack of development between 2014 - 2016, there will be some DIY wearable devices as well. For this matter, I personally cherry picked ones those have features that could benefit Sociometric Badge.t could benefit Sociometric Badge.",

The first on is hard - reset (the hardcore method) by plugging off the power cable which is not recommended. The second method is to shutdown via CLI or desktop environment, then plug off the power cable after the system turned off.\n\n\nSo, I think the ideal case in this scenario is to have 2 switches. The first switches is to shutdown the operating system, while the second switches will be to disconnect battery and the Raspberry PI itself.\n\n\nI found the a tutorial here, \nhttp://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/Archive/2013/01/Adding-an-On-Off-switch-to-your-Raspberry-Pi\n, but I have not yet test it.\n\n\nI just realized that the tutorial is 5 pages.

            "text": "Lovegety, \"physical Tinder\" badge.\n\n\nThere was this electronics badge that was used as a matchmaking tools in Japan.\n\n\nThere were 3 preferences that you can pick to identify what you want from your potential match. These preferences are these.\n\n\n\"Let's just chat.\".\n\n\n\"Let's go sing some karaoke.\".\n\n\n\"Get2\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think the last one is for sex? I am not sure, if Asian people is into this kind of random \"meet and sex\" stuffs.\n\n\nFrom the Wikipedia page of Lovegety here, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovegety\n, \"Get2\" mode is inferred as a \"looking for love\" mode.\n\n\nIt could means, \"looking for girlfriend\" as well.\n\n\nIt works just similar to Tinder, you set your preference, walk, if there is opposite gender that also has the same preference the Lovegety badge will start to notify its wearer.\n\n\nI am thinking on how this badge would notify its wearer. Probably using small vibration motor or beeping sound.\n\n\nBut, in densely populated area like Tokyo beeping sound could not be easily heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this article from Yahoo as well (I took this article from the Internet way back machine), \nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20091027114257/http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Bunker/5921/lovegety.html\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for love in Japan Cyber Space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronics device to get love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe detection range for this badge is 15 feet so it is around 5 meters (4.572 meters to be exact).\n\n\nThe badge is priced around 21 US Dollars. Which in my opinion will be quite expensive to buy nowadays, since you can have everything infinitely small and cheaper as a smartphone application anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis badge had been sold over 600.000 in Japan, so there were potentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah, the main idea is to play \"Pokemon GO\" but instead of searching for Pokemon you need to search for your love partner.\n\n\nThis badge is usually used in nightclub or similar spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, with this badge the wearer can be more aggressive by turning on feature that let both transmitter and transmittee know to each other by more powerful beeping sound notification.\n\n\nThis answer to my previous question, several points above. The notification methods are either bleeping sound or LEDs as it is shown in the Lovegety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the Lovegety badge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way female users to refuse match if the guy is not her cup of tea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are blue bottomed badge for male user.\n\n\nThere are pink bottomed badge for female user.\n\n\nThere are nothing for homosexual or transgender badge just yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make things easier the company made a website to let the users to post a status like where the badge wearer will be around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeluxe model allows you to have range into up to 100 meters.\n\n\nBut this raises question, if you have the deluxe badge, whereas others only have the normal Lovegety badge. This means that your badge can know other badge in range, but people with normal badge will not get the notification because the range of the deluxe version in further.\n\n\nFull article screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an article about Lovegety from Wikipedia, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovegety\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were actually a concern from western critic about privacy of the user of Lovegety badge.",

Try to not make everything broad, but maintain the scope control to make everything not necessarily to be so specific.\n\n\nYour opinion is not valid resource.

In fact, sometime research paper writers are told to avoid using Wikipedia at all. The main reason is that information can be changed at any time by anyone. Because the researcher has no way of knowing the credentials or biases of those adding to, or deleting from the research, it is not considered a credible source.\n\n\nRemember to always evaluate your sources.\n\n\nThere are always online library resource from your university.

Perhaps this is done using the angle sensors that is 1 of the 4 sensors in the Sociometric Badge.\n\n\nUsing the RFID the badge know who you are currently talking to.\n\n\nAnd also the location of when the conversation happen.\n\n\nThis is achieved with the RFID.

So that is it means a lot of stuffs from the Sociometric Badge can be rebuild using newer technology?\n\n\nThere is this term called \"reality mining\" using some electronics sensor.\n\n\n1 thing that make me not quite sure is that how can thing that small have a processing power to process speech? The device itself was made using technology from < 2010. Perhaps using the same technology like the 2010 cell phones?\n\n\nThe main initial idea is for the technology to be a wearable technology.

This is an example.\n\n\n\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    render_template(\n        \"which_template_you_want_to_use.html\",\n        any_variable_1=\"any_value_although_it_is_usually_string\",\n        any_variable_2=\"any_value_although_it_is_usually_string\",\n        any_variable_3=\"any_value_although_it_is_usually_string\",\n        any_variable_4=\"any_value_although_it_is_usually_string\",\n        any_variable_5=\"any_value_although_it_is_usually_string\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen these variables can be called in the template \n\"which_template_you_want_to_use.html\"\n with \n{{any_variable_1}}\n.\n\n\nThis is an example specifically for Flask.\n\n\nThere is template inheritance as well.\n\n\nThe sub - template is what usually the main display as it is the same case with \nwhich_template_you_want_to_use.html\n.\n\n\nThe super template is the main template (the larger HTML files with all CSS and JS files attached into it) that will be added with functionalities from the sub - template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in analogous, super template is the function and the sub - template is the arguments.\n\n\nBut needed to be known that argument can be a function as well.\n\n\nHence, this can be further dumbed down into several sub - template.\n\n\nThere is block tag like this, \n{% block %}\n this is meant for the sub - template to fill and for super template to reference which part of it got filled by child template.\n\n\nExample \n{% block %}\n in sub - template.\n\n\n\n\n{% block this_from_sub_template %}\n  {# Put some HTML or Jinja2 codes here. #}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample \n{% block %}\n in super template.\n\n\n\n\n{% block this_from_sub_template %}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn super template we just do not fill anything in between of the Jinja2 tag.\n\n\nDo not forget to put \n{% extends \"the_super_template.html\" %}\n in the uppermost of the sub - template.\n\n\nIf you need to render a block from super template then use this \n{{super()}}\n. This is the example codes.\n\n\n\n\n{# These codes are in sub - function. #}\n{% block footer %}\n    {# These codes will take `footer` block from whatever this template     extends from. #}\n  {{super()}}\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is macros as well in Jinja2.\n\n\nMacros is like a function but for the templating engine.\n\n\nHere is an example of macros in Jinja2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of using built - in filter as well as to make custom filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the screenshot of the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is all kind of expression that can be used within Jinja2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is all documentation available for Jinja2, \nhttp://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/\n.",

For example, Java, JavaScript, ....\n\n\nThe medium level programming language, that resides in the middle between high level programming language and low level programming language. This kind of programming language capable of doing human - language level of operation as well as machine language level operation (accessing memory, defining memory allocation, ...). The example of this programming language is the C variants, except for C# that is more similar to Java than any other C variants.\n\n\nThe low level languages are solely speak machine language. The example of these programming languages are Assembly and Machine Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is StackOverflow discussion about \"level\" in programming language, \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3468068/low-mid-high-level-language-whats-the-difference\n.\n\n\nHere is the screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman language is not grammatically strict.\n\n\nThis means that human can speak with wrong grammar and people will still understand it.\n\n\nOn the other hand, computer/machine language is grammatically strict.\n\n\nHowever, it says in here that both of human language and computer/machine language follow a same principle.\n\n\nI just do not know what is the principle meant in this screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasual computing activity refer to computing activity with graphical user interfaces.\n\n\nFor example non - casual computing activity will be programming with programming language.\n\n\nThe hardcore, computing activity will be to programming computer machine directly by allocating its memory blocks manually.\n\n\nSo, the more user interface available for the human the more casual computing activity it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually in more flexible operating system, for example in desktop operating system like, Linux, MacOs, or Windows every users can still do the non - casual computing to hardcore computing if they know what and where to set the environment.\n\n\nOne example of good non - casual \"tool\" for computing activity is JavaScript.\n\n\nJavaScript is exists in almost every web browser.\n\n\nThis means that JavaScript is exists in about every consumer device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with programming is that the programmer often get lost in their own maze.\n\n\nProgrammers often feel alienated from the program that they are making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning is a hard work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer programmer can built universe with nearly unlimited possible combinations.\n\n\nAlthough, there will still be limitations right and left.\n\n\nThe screenshot is from Joseph Weizenbaum, from his book titled \"Computer Power And Human Reason.\"\n\n\nHere is the link to the book, \nhttp://blogs.evergreen.edu/cpat/files/2013/05/Computer-Power-and-Human-Reason.pdf\n.\n\n\nHere is the .pdf of the book.\n\n\n\n\n./20170325-1435-cet-introduction-11.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no proper analogy to compare computer program with any physical real - life things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer is a machine that capable to host these immaterial machines.\n\n\nThese immaterial machine refers to simple memory allocation operation of computing activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing is used to execute simple task with incredibly high speed.\n\n\nHowever, this simple task can be stacked with other simple task to construct near infinite possible operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping codes under control is a programmer's bane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe programming is actually the art of controlling complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot way to do stuffs in programming.\n\n\nHowever, as it is mentioned here, programmers tend to stick in a way.\n\n\nSometimes, any programmers who would like to think out side of the box from their codes will be outcast and labeled as a \"bad programmer\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming is an ever updated profession.\n\n\nOne needs to keep exploring and learning on the possible new technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the earliest low level programming languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then people starting to understand that it could be made more humane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then there is an incentive to name a memory block. This is then what it is now variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif\n, \nwhile\n, ... are an example of programming construct.\n\n\nThese already set as a set of operations in lower level language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery number that you put in a statement will \"technically\" construct a variable.\n\n\nYou could see that as \ncompare\n variable in an example from above screeshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming language defines a lot of uninteresting details of programming for higher level developer to program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of the shortest definition of loop in the most concise operation possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sum up, program can be made in any way possible, from long to short, from unreadable into readable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript has nothing to do with Java.\n\n\nJava was first and then JavaScipt came.\n\n\nAt the time when JavaScript is invented Java was (I think), the most popular programming language.\n\n\nThus, JavaScript developer wants to bandwagon their creation to Java.\n\n\nHence, the name JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript and ECMAScript is the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript is very liberal programming language.\n\n\nJavaScript has low entry point for beginner.\n\n\nHowever, as your project grows it will getting significantly harder to manage your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upcoming JavaScript is the ECMAScript 6 JavaScript that will be updated soon enough. There are several web browsers those already apply ECMAScript partially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb browsers is not the only platforms in JavaScript.\n\n\nSome database like MongoDB and CouchDB use JavaScript as their programming and query language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodeJS capable of doing system level operation through JavaScript codes.\n\n\nAlthough, NodeJS itself is built with C++ back - end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease consider active learning when learning everything.\n\n\nTry to practice the theory.\n\n\nThis may slow, but you will get easier learning the next similar thing you want to learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not assume you are understand before you are doing the solution by yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as do not forget to exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a source code for everything those are listed in this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the overview of the book.\n\n\nThere will be a chapter where I asked to develop myself these things.\n\n\nArtificial life simulator.\n\n\nDynamic website.\n\n\nPain program.\n\n\nPlatformer video game.\n\n\nProgramming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am wondering what they meant by creating abstract codes?\n\n\nIt says here that the more abstract your code is, the more control you have over the codes you made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a chapter about error handling and fixing as well.\n\n\nAnd regular expression.\n\n\nRegular expression is the best way to do string manipulation.\n\n\nI wanted to learn this, but I saw there is a ton of specifics syntax to selecting and modifying text, hence I cowered up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModularity is another example on writing clean codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall structure of the book.",

I think this means RAM, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery set of bits has a role.\n\n\nThis role is what it is data type in higher level programming language.\n\n\nIn JavaScript there are these 6 types of basic values.\n\n\nFunction.\n\n\nNumber.\n\n\nObject.\n\n\nString.\n\n\nUndefined value.\n\n\nUndefined.\n\n\nNull.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* To create value, in JavaScript, you can just invoke its name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript engine usually has its own memory allocation algorithm.\n\n\nNevertheless, the only problem would be if you need \nall\n variables to be exists at the same time.\n\n\nIn case not, variable's memory block will be \"rotated\" accordingly as it is in the memory allocation algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere used to be a problem with accidentally overflowing the value of a variable.\n\n\nEspecially in 8 bits or 16 bits computer.\n\n\nToday computer is at least 32 bits to 64 bits.\n\n\nThere should be no problem on dealing larger variable's value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe positivity of a number (whether it is positive or negative number) as well as decimal point are stored on another block of memory.\n\n\nHence, float and negative float number need more memory blocks.\n\n\nThe maximum number of decimal points can be stored with JavaScript (this paragraph does mention whether this is meant for computer or JavaScript in general) is 9 quadrillion (15 trailing zeros), which is still good for most program written in JavaScript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of exponent notation.\n\n\nFor example, \n2.999e8\n means \n2.999*10^8\n.\n\n\nFor example, \n2.999e-8\n means \n2.999*10^-8\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor number with infinite amount of trailing numbers behind comma, like for example pi.\n\n\nThe ideal case would be an approximation.\n\n\nSo, programmers need to be careful when dealing with decimal numbers. The best is to make an approximation of those numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperators are most of the time is a symbol.\n\n\nMathematics operator like \n+\n, \n-\n, ....\n\n\nThere are these kinds of operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach operators in any programming language has its own order of magnitude.\n\n\nThe larger the more priority it has over the lower ones.\n\n\nIf there are operators with same priority the left will be executed first.\n\n\nThese all means the basic mathematics equation on which one should be calculated first addition or multiplication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when designing a statement you need to make sure the order of the operators you would like to happen first.\n\n\nThen, assign bracket appropriately.\n\n\nActually, just try to put everything in bracket for you to make sure that the operator will happen after the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is \ninfinity\n and \n-infinity\n to represent positive and negative infinity.\n\n\nAnything happen to \ninfinity\n will still be \ninfinity\n, perhaps the negative or the positive change. There are these examples.\n\n\ninfinity + 1\n is still \ninfinity\n.\n\n\ninfinity - 1\n is still \ninfinity\n.\n\n\nHowever, I am still not sure on what will be for \ninfinity/-infinity\n. Will this be \n-1\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese numbers are not mathematically solid.\n\n\nDo not use this, if possible.\n\n\nThere are little to no use for the programmer to use this, but if this comes from a result of a calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaN\n is stand for \"not a number\".\n\n\nNaN\n is used to represent a result that is not meaningful.\n\n\nThese are an example of operations those will return null.\n\n\n0/0\n will return \nNaN\n.\n\n\nInfinity - Infinity\n will return \nNaN\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny operation that is not meaningful will return as a \nNaN\n in JavaScript.\n\n\nIn other programming language this could be a Math error.\n\n\nThis is actually the thing that I do not like from JavaScript.\n\n\nNaN\n does not return error. So, sometimes it is hard to debug a mathematical based animation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewlines is what it is when you press Enter key in your keyboard while typing something.\n\n\nString (or text) in JavaScript should be put in a line.\n\n\nYou cannot put a line break in a string directly by pressing Enter.\n\n\nInstead you should use \n\\n\n to imply line break to the JavaScript interpreter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscaping character is a character that will not be included in the quoted text (string).\n\n\nIn JavaScript or any general programming language (Python included) the escaping character is \n\\\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove are examples of escaping character to incites line break as well as string operation.\n\n\nThere is only one operator that can be used to do string operator which is \n+\n.\n\n\n+\n if there are at least one parameter is a string. Then type coercion will happen. This, will make the whole operation to be string concatenation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnary operation is an operation that take one parameter.\n\n\nUsually unary operation takes the right side of th operator to be its parameter.\n\n\nWhereas binary operation takes what it is in the left and the right of the operator.\n\n\nFor example, \n1 + 2\n is a binary operator.\n\n\nThat operation will take \n1\n and \n2\n as its parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of unary operation is \ntypeof\n which to return a string of the parameter's type data.\n\n\nAnother example of unary operation is \n-\n and \n!\n. These are use to inverse numbers and boolean respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are another example of binary operator.\n\n\nThis time this is a operator for comparison.\n\n\nComparison operator will return a boolean value (whether it is \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above paragraph, I know that string can also be compared.\n\n\nEvery character has its own Unicode and string comparison will compare between these Unicode.\n\n\nGood thing to mention is that lower case is larger than upper case.\n\n\nFor example, \na > Z\n will return \ntrue\n.\n\n\nThe Unicode standard applied to any symbol you see in your computer.\n\n\nThese includes Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Japanese, ....\n\n\nWhen comparing string, JavaScript goes from the left to right and go step - by - step in increasing index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaN == Nan\n will be false, although both value is the same.\n\n\nNaN\n is the only value in JavaScript that will return \nfalse\n when compared to itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaN\n, in JavaScript, is used to determine the result of nonsensical computation.\n\n\nAnd as such it does not equal to other nonsensical results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnary operation \n!\n or not, is used to flip the value of boolean.\n\n\nFor example, \n!false\n will be \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing all the operation.\n\n\nThe most important thing when programmer tries to make a statement is to take care which one is more operators has more priority then the other.\n\n\nFor example this below is a valid JavaScript operation.\n\n\n\n\n1 + 1 == 2 && 10 * 10 > 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe programmer needs to define which operators will happen first.\n\n\nOtherwise, to make sure and for safety you can also bind the operators and the parameters in a brackets of \n()\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, based on above paragraph.\n\n\nMathematical operations will happen first.\n\n\nSo these means all of those, \n%\n, \n*\n, \n+\n, \n-\n, \n/\n.\n\n\nBut each has its own priority that otherwise will be taken from left to right.\n\n\nFor example \n*\n will happen first, then \n-\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next priority is those comparison operator: \n>\n, \n<\n, \n>=\n, \n<=\n, \n==\n, \n!=\n, \n===\n, \n!==\n.\n\n\nThen \"and\" operation \n&&\n.\n\n\nThen \"or\" operation \n||\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only one ternary operation in JavaScript which is used for conditional value assignment.\n\n\nTernary operation is operation that takes 3 parameters.\n\n\nThese are the examples.\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(true ? \"hello\" : \"world\") // Will print \"hello\" in the console.\nconsole.log(false ? \"hello\" : \"world\") // Will print \"world\" in the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe previous point is a conditional operation.\n\n\nThe value on the left of the question mark will assign a boolean comparison.\n\n\nThe value on the left of \":\" will be assigned if the boolean comparison is \ntrue\n.\n\n\nThe value on the right of \":\" will be assigned if the boolean comparison is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany operation in JavaScript do not produce meaningful value.\n\n\nIn JavaScript this will be shown as \nnull\n or \nundefined\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnull\n and \nundefined\n are an accident during the JavaScript development.\n\n\nIn most of the time these values do not matter.\n\n\nBut for me, I define \nundefined\n as if I have a variable but I have not yet to put a value in it.\n\n\nnull\n will be used to define an \"empty\" variable that used to have value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI you have concern on the operator's priority, then it is the best solution to have each operations within a bracket. Thus, you can assign the priority properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of automatic type conversion in JavaScript.\n\n\nThis is what it means to be programming/scripting language with type coercion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen something does not mapped properly to a number or a boolean in an obvious way, a \nNaN\n will be the result.\n\n\nFor example, \n\"five\" - \"four\"\n will be \nNaN\n (I think, I have not yet try this, in any cases I hope you get my point).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo overall, in case JavaScript programmer find a \nNaN\n bug, they need to see on potential type coercion.\n\n\nUsually \nNaN\n happen because of division by 0 or unwanted type coercion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType coercion exists when comparing values.\n\n\nExample of valid type coercion within comparison operator.\n\n\n\"\" == false\n will return \ntrue\n.\n\n\n0 == false\n will return \ntrue\n.\n\n\nNaN == false\n will return \ntrue\n.\n\n\nnull == 0\n will return \ntrue\n.\n\n\nnull == undefined\n will return \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use comparison to know if your data is valid.\n\n\nFor example, you can use \n\"\" == false\n to check the validity of string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent type coercion when comparing value, in JavaScript you can use \n===\n or \n!==\n.\n\n\nBoth operators are binary operator.\n\n\nBoth operators mean as a strict comparison operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended in JavaScript to have all comparison to be in strict comparison.\n\n\nSo you are sure that both type and the value are the same (or not).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful, in JavaScript there are comparison operator that can act as a value validator.\n\n\nThese operators are \n||\n and \n&&\n.\n\n\nThe \n||\n is used to take the left parameter if the left parameter is valid and take the right parameter if the left parameter is invalid.\n\n\nI would call the \n||\n as a left valid checker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis technique is called \"short - circuiting logical operator\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n&&\n is a left invalid checker.\n\n\nThe \n&&\n will check left parameter is invalid then return that value.\n\n\nFor both \n||\n and \n&&\n will try to return the left value if the left value satisfy the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the condition is satisfied already, then there will be no check on the right parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conditional operator (the only ternary operation JavaScript has) works in similar way.\n\n\nThe first value is checked if it it true than the operation end without checking another value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue in JavaScript is inferred by typing its name directly.\n\n\nFor example, \ntrue\n, \nnull\n or the arbitrary values, like \n13\n or \n\"abc\"\n.\n\n\nYou can combine or transform value with operator.\n\n\nLearning what operators are available is a crucial part when learning a programming/scripting language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conclusion for this chapter.",

            "text": "Object pooling in programming is a technique to re - use object instead of re - initiating new ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, polling means that you do not create new object, but you look into which object is available to be use inside a list.\n\n\nThe way object is controlled (added back, remove, edit) is by using flags. For this example, this chapter uses \nbool inUse_\n to determine if there is operation that affects the object or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to use pooling.\n\n\nYou need many similar object that frequently created and destroyed. For example, bullet or particle.\n\n\nThe objects are similar in size.\n\n\nAllocating dynamic memory is always slower than allocating fixed memory.\n\n\nEncapsulate persistent stream. For example database connection or networking. Imagine, for every time you initiated the object it takes time to establish this connection. So better initiate all connections in the beginning (caching).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually programming language has garbage collector.\n\n\nBy using pooling, it means you are making your own garbage collector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pool object should be able to manage all objects that it is in the pool.\n\n\nFor example if the app/game wants to activate an object but there are no object that can be used, this, should returns null.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle sized pool is bad.\n\n\nMultiple sized pool for each needs are better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to activate an object in a pool but there are none that can be used. Then, try to find the most \"useless\" object to be turn off so that it can be used for an object that is more important. Check the sound example above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn heterogeneous pool, make sure each slot is the same size.\n\n\nAnd make sure the size of the slot is the largest possible object that the pool can hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways re - factor the pool in case it can be dumbed down into smaller classifications. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful if you are using pool with native garbage collector from the programming language (for example for any programming language that is not C variant).\n\n\nThere could be potential conflict between garbage collector and your self - made pool. Especially when objects in the pool has reference to other object that can be collected by the garbage collector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways initiate the objects with \"inactive\" flag set false.\n\n\nIn most case you want the object to have no constructor.\n\n\nAn then there would be additional \ninit()\n function to re - init the object if being used again after it is not being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of pool class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a problem if a pool need to be bigger. Iterate it will cost processing speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this \nfriend\n function in C++. I do not know on what it is.\n\n\nfriend\n is a statement for classes or methods, so that only tagged \nfriend\n can borrow functionality of that corresponding \nclass\n or \nfunction\n.\n\n\nThe main C++ documentation is here, \nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/\n.\n\n\nIn a nut shell, \nfriend\n is used to access \nclass\n or \nfunction\n from other class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best practice is not to use flags but to return a boolean based on values from other variables.\n\n\nBut, in my opinion it is always the best/fastest to create flags first, then later determine which flags can be deleted (seemed to be unnecessary).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject coupling means, whether or not the object and its pool know each others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding \"safety net\" into our self - made pool class.\n\n\nAdding debug features into the self - made pool class to make it easy to know general information of objects inside the pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is \nunion\n in C++?\n\n\nBased on this web page, \nhttp://www.mycplus.com/tutorials/c-programming-tutorials/unions-structures/\n.\n\n\nA union is a user defined variable which may hold members of different sizes and type. Union uses a single memory location to hold more than one variable. We can use the unions in the following locations.\n\n\nExample of \nunion\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunion myUnion{\n    int var1;\n    long var2;\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is more like an answer for statically typed programming language like C to more \"dynamically\" typed programming language.\n\n\nWhen do you need to use \nunion\n? In the web page, it says, \"We don\u2019t know what type of data is to be passed to a function, and you pass union which contains all the possible data types.\".\n\n\nHere is the full screenshot of the web page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a technique called free list that makes you to utilize objects in the pool that is not active.\n\n\nThe key here is hold reference to the next important object reference, chained through object in the loop.\n\n\nFor example in current active object you want to modify, you put a reference into the next available object that can be activated (initiated) and reference to the next object that is not active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can make sure that object can only be created in its corresponding pool by \nfriend\n - ing the object and the pool class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of codes if you want to initialize the object outside the pool.\n\n\nThe most important things is to keep the reference into every new objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it was mentioned before, do not forget to create a \"fail - safe\". What will happen if the program tries to create/init new object where there no memory slot/available objects to be recycled?\n\n\nThe example codes above is one example of \"fail - safe\" if all object in the pool is currently active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a technique called \"fly weight\" to maintain object that shares same resources (for example fonts, meshes, point to CSV, connection queue, ...).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to use CPU cache to its maximum capability.\n\n\nHere are some notes that I took in my note book.",

Two weeks prior arriving, we had changed in our flight (got delayed by a day because my stupid mistake) and Ana altered our reservation.\n\n Simple route, easy to access, and easy to remember. Go out from this house, turn right in the big road, and walking ~15 minutes will get you into the city center.\n\n The accommodation is well designed and look cozy. It looks what it is on the photos.\n\n The price!\n* There is a kitchen. Usually with this price you would not get something like this. Nevertheless, when we live there, we did not use the kitchen.\n\n\nThe cons are these.\n\n Lack of heaters, there are main heater and two portable heaters, but for us that was enough. We tricked this by having additional blankets.\n\n The hot water need to \"charged\". So sometimes there is no or little hot water. However, in our last day we had no problem with hot water after the previous night Ana told me this information.\n\n\nMy score is 4/5, would give 5/5 if there is no heater problem.\nAm I recommending this?

This is not good if you want to get new idea/perspective. Determined thought pattern.\n\n Diffuse mode of thinking you look at the big picture perspective.\n\n You can in the both thinking mode (diffuse and focus mode) at the same time.\n\n This lecture is meant to reduce frustration and increase understanding.\n\n Salvador Dali used diffuse thinking. He works with relaxed mind.\n\n Thomas Edison let his mind runs free. Make the idea in diffuse mode and then arrange every idea in focus mode.\n\n Building neural habit everyday.\n\n Metaphor helps to provide powerful media for learning something that is difficult.\n\n Learning difficult takes time (this is obvious).\n\n Human brain weights 3 pounds but consume 10 times more energy than weight for the rest of the body.\n\n Heavy lifting (act and thinking) happen below human level of consciousness.\n\n The lecturer recommends this website to be visited, \nhttp://brainfacts.org\n.\n\n Procrastination issue. If we are doing something, we are procrastinating on everything else.\n\n There is an area in the brain that is called Insular Cortex. This is a specific part in the brain that associates/holds feeling of discomfort/pain.\n\n When there is a negative stimulation, brain tries to distract/switch attention to different things. These different things are something those are more simple and more pleasant to do and fast enough to get achievement with (for example video games or YouTube videos).\n\n However, scientist believe that as soon we start doing thing that we meant to do the feeling of discomfort/pain is gone.\n\n So to stop procrastinating we just need to start something right away. The hardest part is to start, after that everything will go on with ease.\n\n There is a Pomodoro technique. This is like mental gym then mental relaxation. This is simple to do.\n    * Start doing thing with no distraction for 25 minutes.\n    * So this will be 25 minutes of full concentration.\n    * After 25 minutes do some relaxation for 5 minutes.\n    * For every 2 hours do 15 minutes of relaxation.\n    * For me and most people coffee or tea helps!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample analogy of focused mode.\n\n\nThe the diffused mode counterpart has way less obstacles.\n\n\nThis pinball analogy means that the mind wander around on exact route (focused mode).\n\n\nThe other pinball analogy is for diffused mode of which has way less obstacles. This means that the mind wander more freely than when there are a lot of obstacles (focused mode).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome credits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother credits and other relevant readings as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technique to get out of procrastination is called Pomodoro technique.\n\n\nSet 25 minutes to be on full attention mode. There is no distraction at all (not even a bit). Then after the 25 minutes passed goes to have break for 5 minutes.\n\n\nBoth 25 minutes and 5 minutes are equally important because those 25 minutes will make our brain tired and makes the 5 minutes break become a necessity to cool our brain down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother credits and recommended readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the pinball analogy of diffused and focused mode.\n\n\nNote that the difference is that the focused mode is more deterministic than the diffused mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course objectives.\n\n\nDiffused mode and focused mode of thinking.\n\n\nChunking!\n\n\nWorking memory and long term memory.\n\n\nThese methods.\n\n\nDeliberate practice.\n\n\nInterleaving.\n\n\nMetaphor.\n\n\nPomodoro.\n\n\nStory.\n\n\nVisualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAble to determine what is/are the problem(s).\n\n\nChoking.\n\n\nEinstellung.\n\n\nIllusions of learning.\n\n\nLack of sleep.\n\n\nMulti tasking.\n\n\nOver learning.\n\n\nProcrastination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant aspects of test preparation.\n\n\nExplain the important of mindset in learning.

            "text": "Practice makes permanent. Do something that is smaller and not so ambitious before taking into more ambitious goal.\n\n\nDr. Barbara Oakley, professor of engineering started learning mathematics and science at age 26. Before she hated mathematics and would not think to start career in mathematics.\n\n\nEngineering and science is an abstract idea. Hence, it is harder to learn. Human is easier to learn when there are a concrete example present.\n\n\nThere is this neural pattern. I think this is like myelin (muscle memory) but for thinking. This neural pattern must be built periodically.\n\n\nDo not learn by cramming everything into short period of times. Hence, over a night study before examination is never preferable.\n\n\nThere are long term memory and working memory.\n\n\nWorking memory is like computer RAM (random access memory). Working memory is processing what is currently happen.\n\n\nThe lecturer said that working memory is like inefficient mental black board.\n\n\nScientists used to says that working memory is capable of holding 6 chunks of information.\n\n\nHowever, they later revised this into only 4 chunks of information that can be hold at a given time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong term memory is like computer HDD/SSD which meant to store something permanently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the mission here is to transfer working memory into long term memory.\n\n\nThere is a technique called space repetition. Which means to repeat what we have learn in interval of days. Perhaps like at the 1st day I started to learn and then I repeat again what I have learn in 1st day for every 2 or 3 days. This is just like waiting cement to dry before adding additional bricks.\n\n\nSo here repeating is the key.\n\n\nIt is also said somewhere that without repeating working memory would go nowhere.\n\n\nSleeping gets rid of poison in the brain.\n\n\nIf you take a test without sleeping, that means that in the test you are thinking with metabolic toxins in your brain. Which makes you cannot think properly.\n\n\nHaving less sleep time also not good. Because this destroys your natural timer of sleeping and working.\n\n\nSleeping is like defragmenting partition in computer. It removes unnecessary memory block and make sure everything runs seamlessly again.\n\n\nAlso proper sleeping make sure you have chance to having dream about the material you want to learn. This will increase power of memory of material you have studied. Because you have something to correlate with.\n\n\nIs lucid dreaming the key to have every material to be dreamed in?\n\n\nI know, there is a technique to have 100% rate of lucid dreaming every time someone is sleeping.\n\n\nInterview with Doctor Sejnowski.\n\n\nWhat you do to learn something new?\n\n\nI like to get practical and learn by doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to pay attention to boring lecture?\n\n\nMake it interactive by asking question. However, he said there is no simple thing to achieve this. Hence, I think the solution will vary from person to person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get into diffuse mode of thinking?\n\n\nExercise and waling is a simple way to get into diffuse mode of thinking.\n\n\nThe problem is then how to remember those ideas you get from the diffuse thinking session.\n\n\nDoctor Sejnowski said that it is good to bring a notebook to capture those ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you do multi tasking?\n\n\nMulti tasking is necessary.\n\n\nThere are a lot of things those he needs to take attention of, for example emails, ....\n\n\nThe solution here is to juggle within task.\n\n\nFor him he has a specific time in the afternoon to have reflective session of which he everything mostly done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you do multiple things at once?\n\n\nThis is possible but hard!\n\n\nSome people are better than other at doing multiple things at once.\n\n\nSwitching between tasks are hard because you cannot switch things in the middle of focus.\n\n\nFortunately for him, he has colleagues and students that helped him with doing multiple things at once (delegation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you apply your study of neuroscience in your own life?\n\n\nLearning to change connection between neuron.\n\n\nShrinkage of the cortex, hippocampus.\n\n\nMost mammals has 2 hippocompi.\n\n\nHippocompus is used to store short and long term memory (working and long term memory).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew neurons can even born in the adulthood. The key is to exercise and live healthy I think.\n\n\nDo social activity. Social activity makes neuron connection to be 100% stronger (twice stronger).\n\n\nExercise improve the number of neuron born and survive.\n\n\nAlso need to live healthy!\n\n\nSwitch from brain memory and muscle memory. When you are tired on the other make sure to switch into other form of memory. To use muscle instead of using brain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have special technique?\n\n\nBeing in creative environment.\n\n\nHaving other people to bounce idea around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you keep creative?\n\n\nStay in good environment.\n\n\nColleagues and student.\n\n\nBasically having youth around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny advice for high school or college student?\n\n\nTo be passionate and persistent!\n\n\nHe have seen people who is smart but is not success because they have no passion and not persistent.\n\n\nPassion and persistent is the best quality that people emust have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis Crick brain. Nobel prize for discovery of DNA.\n\n\nDoctor Sejnowski said that to learn you need to always see from different perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice makes perfect, enough said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding strong neural structures.\n\n\nIn order make a good foundation, cramming/learning everything in one day is not good.\n\n\nLearn everyday and makes it to be a good foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace repetition technique.\n\n\nMeans that every 2 or 3 days you repeat what you have learn.

            "text": "Chunking, compact package of information that brain can easily access.\n\n\nIllusion of competence in learning. This is when you feel that you are learning but you are not. For example when you are learning something simple over and over. This might give you feeling that you are learning a lot, but in fact you are not!\n\n\nOver learning means that ineffective learning.\n\n\nInterleaving means variety in learning. For example while you are studying chapter 1 in a calculus book you also skip once at a time to further chapter to give you bigger image on what you will learn next.\n\n\nBrand new concept creates an abstract concept that is hard to understand.\n\n\nImagine this as a puzzle, chunk it into as smallest notion as possible and have others chunks to be able to connect together to build bigger concept.\n\n\nChunk is a piece of information. That can be connected to other chunk to form bigger piece of information.\n\n\nChunk is just like a puzzle, except it is a flexible one that you can use in another puzzle.\n\n\nYou can easily learn something if you have a good connection and habit to it. For example it is easier for a child to learn Spanish if the parent is speaking Spanish everyday.\n\n\nThe first step to learn/teach (path to expertise) something formally is to create a mental chunk to kick start your brain to know/remember/understand something.\n\n\nSo always start to understand something from the basic when you are learning something new.\n\n\nNeural chunk also apply to art and sport. Basically to anything that human can learn.\n\n\nPractice and repetition are the main tools to creating chunks, especially on developing technique.\n\n\nChunk is a small main idea, it comes from the bigger idea that might be unknown for you.\n\n\nIt is like getting dress in the morning. Start by just getting the dress then wear it. This simple starting activity could get you to get bigger activity to be done. This is similar on how to stop procrastinating by just to start doing things.\n\n\nIt is the same if you want to understand something. You just need to start to understand the smallest possible thing that you can understand and then step up bit by bit to bigger concept.\n\n\nFor example if you want to learn how to play a song with guitar. The chunks are probably as follows.\n\n\nListen the song first.\n\n\nWatch someone play the song using guitar.\n\n\nAfter several chunks later you can piece together and start understanding the bigger technique which is playing guitar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn learning a sport. You need to create chunks based on what skills you need to master sport. Then learn it one by one.\n\n\nThe best chunk would make you to automatically connects it to another chunk.\n\n\nThe best way to learn mathematics or other science related study is not to learn it by the solution. Instead you need to create smallest chunk then figure out the connection. Hence it is easier for you to understand grander concept.\n\n\nCreating chunk is harder if you learn something by example.\n\n\nExample solution should not be used as a \"do as what I told you\" kind of solution. Instead it should be used as a map as a guidance.\n\n\nBasic step to make a chunk is different between field (history, sport, ...).\n\n\nThese are these steps to develop chunk.\n\n\nThe first step is to focus on what kind of knowledge you want to chunk.\n\n\nSecond step is that you need to understand the arbitrary/simplest/smallest idea of the idea you want to chunk.\n\n\nClosing the book method can help you to test if you understand the topic.\n\n\nThis means that you should not try to remember stuffs but to understand stuffs.\n\n\nBy doing it yourself helped you to make the neural pattern, hence easier for you to chunk, hence this is why practice is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third step is to assigning context.\n\n\nContext means when for you to use the chunk.\n\n\nPractice help you to broaden your neuron network. Make it more accessible from different paths.\n\n\nThere are these.\n\n\nBottom up learning (chunking). More into contextual, when for you to use specific chunk.\n\n\nTop down learning (big picture). Top down approach lets you to see what chunks you already posses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkimming book before reading it is considered the big picture, top down learning. This gives you the big idea of what you will read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChunk is easier to build with these.\n\n\nFocused attention.\n\n\nPractice to get mastery and to see the bigger picture.\n\n\nUnderstanding of the basic/smallest idea.",

For example what does Learning How to Learn course teach you about.\n\n\nFacebook to share personal achievements. For example if you manage to run 5 kilo meters.\n\n\nForums, IRC Channel, Reddit, ... for a you to share anything related to more specific audience. For example, I use forum and Reddit to get feedback on my programming codes.\n\n\nImgur to share pictures. I use Imgur because people can easily give comment/feedback on the Imgur itself or from Reddit. The pictures that I post here mostly technical screenshot (electrical wiring or programming).\n\n\nScribD.\n\n\nTwitter to share brief thought or feeling to a specific matter(s). Do not forget to use hash tag for you to manage your own Twitter tweet.\n\n\nWiki is a platform for sharing personal knowledge base. You can use Wiki to share bookmarks and your own summarizations. For example a bookmark (URL) to this Learning How to Learn course with a brief description why this bookmark (URL) is matter to you. Another example would be your own step by step on how to overcome procrastination.\n\n\nYouTube to share video. For example I use YouTube to help me to get confident on public speaking with foreign language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is my problem?\n\n\nMy personally problems are these.\n\n\nIt is hard for me to do a thing until it is completely done (learning, project, ...).\n\n\nIt is hard for me to get motivation to do a thing. This results on me procrastinating until the dominoes fall back on me, then I get depressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\n\nThe idea is simple. You show off what you are learning or what you want to learn. You share everything related to your goal whether it is the product itself or the progress.\n\n\nThese need \nnot\n to be emphasized on the \"show off\" itself, but more as a contribution or a way to inspire others.\n\n\nPersonally, when I showing off on my progress toward certain my goal/project, I will have tendency to finish the project. This is because I will feel guilty and shame if people knows that I fail the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the problem of the solution?\n\n\nMost people hates egocentric and narcissistic individual.\n\n\nSometimes your progress is not meant for every people in your circle.\n\n\nThe problems to this method are that not every people willing to see your progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow you should not do this?\n\n\nDo not be egocentric and narcissistic. Specially in social networking like Facebook or Twitter, share the progress as subtle as possible. By sharing subtlety you make sure that only specific people knows what you are going to achieve. For example if you are trying to hit gym everyday try not to add any word in your status or tweet. Instead just put a photo with indirect description.\n\n\nHowever, you should be as informative as possible if the thing that you want to show off is more into technical matter like electronics or programming.",

So here there is this tutorial also provided from the DigitalOcean itself, \nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04\n.\n\n\nI wanted to erase unnecessary SSH keys in my DigitalOcean account. So I look here to look for guidance, \nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-remove-ssh-in-digitalocean-portal\n.\n\n\nHere is a tutorial on how to generate SSH key for Linux and MacOS based computer, \nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets\n.\n\n\nThere was a problem when I need to restart the server (I think). This is when I need to restart \nroot\n but there are several root in the display. While in the tutorial there is supposed to be only 1 root. So instead I killed all the connected PID named \nroot\n. I use these codes below, but of course every cases is different.\n\n\n\n\nkill -HUP 1466 && kill -HUP 1497 && kill -HUP 1603 && kill -HUP 1606\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright here I made a mistake, I forget to create SSH authentication for the notalentgeek user.\n\n\nSo, here I learn that SSH need to be connected for every account in the server and not just for root account.\n\n\nI will try to delete the Droplet and start fresh again so that I can understand how this is working.\n\n\nAlright now I am back at the part that I was left. Now, I need to generate SSH keys for the new user.\n\n\nBut first I need to login into the newly created user first.\n\n\nI make a mistake again here, instead of using the key that is already in my local I generate new SSH keys in the server from the newly created user.\n\n\nEverything went fine but for some reason I cannot make the first admin account for my OwnCloud. Here is the error, \nSQLSTATE[HY000][1045] Access denied for user 'user_test'@'localhost' (using password: yes)\n.\n\n\nI suspect this is because I logged in using wrong password. But I tried to logged in using MySQL interactive shell via SSH it works. I am not sure at which part I make a mistake.\n\n\nAt this moment I overcome the database error by just making it using SQLite.\n\n\nNow I am trying to put TagSpaces in my server but it always return 404 error. I suspect this happen due to improper \nchmod\n and \nchown\n.\n\n\nAlright I will try to wrap up for to day. I will not care anymore about MySQL database. I think SQLite would just do the work.\n\n\nI have posted some questions here.\n\n\nhttps://www.tagspaces.org/blog/webdav-edition/\n, here I asking what the author meant by \nyour_www_group:your_www_user\n.\n\n\nhttps://central.owncloud.org/t/error-when-connecting-to-database-when-creating-first-admin-account/3576\n, I tried to ask why I cannot create an admin account in my own OwnCloud. I do not think the responder understand, but nevertheless I am now using SQLite instead of using MySQL.\n\n\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-owncloud-on-ubuntu-16-04\n, here I asked the problem of I cannot login into my \"owncloud\" database (a database names owncloudin MySQL server). This is not relevant anymore since I am using SQLite for this moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suspect the solution I could not login into my MySQL database is because I have not yet to start the MySQL server. This is the command to start off MySQL server under Linux based operating system, \nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql start\n. I can replace the \nstart\n with \nrestart\n or \nstop\n. I found the solution from this StackOverflow discussion, \nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/82374/how-do-i-start-stop-mysql-server\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the SSH keys.\n\n\nI am not sure which one is the SSH keys and which one is passphrase.\n\n\nHere is the thing about passphrase. Although I never try this by myself, I think if I opted \"yes\" when asking to use passphrase or not during when I was generating the SSH keys. I will need to present passphrase key every time I do SSH connection.\n\n\nSo, the passphrase is something like a key file to login. An additional file that is need to presented as a key.\n\n\nBelow are some images that I took during this session. However, the steps are not in order, so make sure to always refer to original tutorials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what happened when I successfully generate SSH keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nnano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n.\n\n\nChange the value of \nPermitRootLogin\n with \nwithout-password\n.\n\n\nSo it will be \nPermitRootLogin without-password\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the tutorial I need to kill all command those have id of \"root\".\n\n\nThere is this thing that might me wondering a bit.\n\n\nIn the tutorial it is shown that I will only have 1 id that is named \"root\". However, in my case there are several id those are named \"root\". So, with my assumption I guess I need to kill all those have id named \"root\".\n\n\nHere are the example codes. But you need to make sure that the number is the same.\n\n\n\n\nkill -HUP 1466 && kill -HUP 1497 && kill -HUP 1603 && kill -HUP 1606\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nnano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n change the \nPasswordAuthentication\n value to \nno\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of which I successfully installed Apache2 server and then accessing it remotely.\n\n\nIf you can see this page then the server is set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is what I get when I successfully installed PHP in the server.",

Otherwise admin account cannot be made because there is no connection to the database.\n\n\nConnect to MySQL server using this command \nsudo systemctl start mysql\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing OwnCloud, download TagSpaces WebDAV version here, \nhttps://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-web.zip\n.\n\n\nExtract everything from the .zip file and then place the \ntagspaces\n folder in \n/var/www/html/\n in your remote server (DigitalOcean droplet).\n\n\nAfter that set owner and permission of the \ntagspaces\n folder.\n\n\n\n\ncd /var/www/html/\nsudo chmod -R 755 tagspaces\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data tagspaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point TagSpaces should have working. Access it at \nhttps://ip_address_here/tagspaces/\n.\n\n\nPut everything that you want to access from TagSpaces in OwnCloud. Use the web interface of OwnCloud to upload files and folders.\n\n\nThose files and folders then can be accessed from TagSpaces by this URL, \n/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/\n.\n\n\nThis URL \n/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/\n will refer to the root directory of OwnCloud.\n\n\nHere are some limitations of WebDAV TagSpaces.\n\n\nThe WebDAV based TagSpaces is not capable of displaying .md (MarkDown) files.\n\n\nThe WebDAV based TagSpaces is also not capable of displaying relative image from .md (MarkDown) files. The \n![./path/to/image.png](./path/to/image.png)\n will not be displayed.\n\n\nIn my case I have \"+\" in my folders name.

Then he was found dead April 14, Phil Katz was slumped against a nightstand in a south side hotel, cradling an empty bottle of peppermint schnapps. The genius who built a multimillion-dollar software company known worldwide for its pioneering \"zip\" files had died of acute pancreatic bleeding caused by chronic alcoholism. He was alone, estranged long ago from his family and a virtual stranger to employees of his own company, PKWare Inc. of Brown Deer. He was 37. It was an ignominious end for a man who created one of the most influential pieces of software in the world - PKZip - and it attracted the attention not only of the techno-faithful but of the mainstream press across the nation. Katz's inventions shrink computer files 50% to 70% to conserve precious space on hard disks. His compression software helped set a standard so widespread that \"zipping\" - compressing a file - became a part of the lexicon of PC users worldwide. But the riches his genius produced were no balm for what had become a hellish life of paranoia, booze and strip clubs. Toward the end, Katz worked only sporadically, firing up his computer late at night, while filling his days with prodigious bouts of drinking and trysts with exotic dancers. Katz owned a condominium in Mequon but rarely stayed there. Desperate to avoid warrants for his arrest, he bounced between cheap hotels near the airport. He got his mail at a Mailboxes Etc. store in Franklin. \"This guy did not have one friend in the world. I mean, a true friend,\" says Chastity Fischer, an exotic dancer who often spent time with Katz and was one of the last people to see him alive. \"Just imagine having nobody in your life. Not anybody to call. Nobody.\" High School Outcast Phil Katz was a quiet, asthmatic child whose athletic pursuits as a kid went no further than riding dirt bikes in his Glendale neighborhood. A 1980 graduate of Nicolet High School, Katz was a \"geek\" long before that term was linked with dot-com companies and piles of money. \"He was an outcast, definitely someone who was picked on,\" says Rick Mayer, who graduated with Katz. \"He spoke in a somewhat nasal tone. He was short, and, well I don't want to say homely, so I'll say he was plain looking.\" After hearing of Katz's death, Ray Fedderly, a Milwaukee cardiologist who sat next to Katz in high school honors math and physics classes, opened his high school yearbook and found an angst-ridden message. \"I enjoyed working with you in mathematics and physics classes through the four terrible, long, unbearable, tortuous, but wonderful years at Nicolet,\" Katz wrote. \"I hope your future is bright and your life is happy (if possible). May a calculator bring great happiness to you.\" \"If I were a physician as I am now when I was 18, I would have known what to do with that note,\" Fedderly says. \"I now know that that was a call for help. That was not a joke.\" A loner by nature, Katz gravitated to analytical pursuits. Katz and his father, Walter, spent weekend afternoons playing chess and evenings writing code for programmable calculators in the days before PCs forever changed computing. Since programmable calculators had very little memory, Phil and Walter had to work very efficiently. \"The earliest program I remember him writing was a game program that dealt with landing on the moon,\" says Brian Kiehnau, Katz's former brother-in-law who met him in 1977. \"It was very crude and simple, but it was complex for what he had in terms of hardware. He got real good at optimizing programs, and he learned to get the job done with the least amount of instructions and running times.\" In 1980, Katz entered the computer science program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Around the same time, Walter and Hildegard Katz bought Phil his first computer, an original IBM PC. It had two floppy drives, a monochrome monitor and 64K of memory, an astoundingly small amount compared with today's machines. Once he got the PC, Katz started writing programs, spending most of his free time on electronic bulletin board services, the precursors of the Internet. The services quickly became Katz's social circle, a place where he hooked up with others who understood his sophisticated programming techniques and shared his passion for computers. Gradually, Katz developed a fondness for sharing information on the services, since interacting with others helped make his programs better. Those experiences would influence Katz to embrace the \"shareware\" approach to distributing PKWare's software. With shareware, users try a product, and if they find it valuable, pay the person who created it. In the case of PKWare, users paid $47 and received a manual and free upgrades. \"He spent many, many hours talking to people and helping people. He would go to computer user groups and spend hours with them,\" Hildegard Katz says. \"He was very, very, giving. This was his great love.\" But in the spring of 1981, tragedy overtook the family, and things would never be the same for Phil Katz. Walter, 55, plagued by recurring chest pains, underwent open heart surgery. Within hours, he was dead. Phil Katz took his father's death very hard. Years later, in the haze of his drinking binges, Katz told Fischer how the loss had affected him. \"It tore him up inside when his father died. One time we went to his grave,\" Fischer says. \"He'd always say that when his father was alive they'd go fishing and do man things.\" Walter's death drove his son further into solitude and deeper into a one-on-one relationship with his computer, say friends and family members. Writing Programs at Night Katz graduated with a computer science degree in 1984 and was hired as a programmer for Allen-Bradley Co. He wrote code to run \"programmable logic controllers,\" which operate manufacturing equipment on shop floors worldwide for Allen-Bradley's customers. Katz left Allen-Bradley in 1986 to work for Graysoft, a Milwaukee-based software company. He spent evenings holed up in his bedroom writing his own programs. His project: An alternative to Arc, the then-common program for compressing files. Using algorithms, Katz wrote programs that imploded information by telling it, for example, to take every \"a-n-d\" out of text. That would eliminate every \"and,\" \"hand,\" and \"sand.\" A good program takes out these and thousands of other combinations of letters and restores them when needed. Katz bounced early versions of the software, called PKArc, off his buddies on the bulletin boards and spent countless hours refining it. By 1987, the software had created such a buzz online that PKArc started to steal market share from Arc's creator, System Enhancement Associates of New Jersey. \"I got a check in the mail and I thought, 'Gee!' that's pretty neat,\" Katz said in a 1994 interview with the Journal Sentinel. \"Then over the next few months, I got more checks in the mail.\" He turned to his mother for help. \"People kept calling him saying, 'We would like to use your software, and we want to pay you money for it,' \" Hildegard says. Katz left Graysoft in 1987 to strike out on his own. PKArc's sales dwarfed his Graysoft salary, which was in the low-$30,000 range, says Steve Burg, a former Graysoft programmer who joined PKWare in 1988. In the beginning, Katz did most of his work at Hildegard's kitchen table. They hired an answering service to handle the flood of phone calls, and offered Burg a job as a developer. Colleagues were impressed by his intellect. \"He was extremely intelligent,\" says Doug Hay, who joined the company in 1988 and stayed until June of last year. \"He had all the equations from exams memorized from 10 years earlier, things you generally forget 20 minutes after the test.\" Almost overnight, denizens of the bulletin boards switched from .arc compression to .zip in what became known as the arc wars. System Enhancement sued PKWare in 1988 for copyright and trademark infringement. In 1989, as his legal costs mounted, Katz agreed to settle. Full terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but representatives of the New Jersey company may have been surprised when they finally met their nemesis. \"The lawyer for System Enhancement showed up at Hildegard's house expecting a big company,\" Kiehnau says. \"He had an address from the bulletin boards, so he thought there would be a big glass building or something. It was really funny.\" Publicity about the lawsuit on bulletin board services nationwide helped fuel a backlash against System Enhancement, which accelerated the death of .arc as PKWare introduced new, incompatible archival tools with better compression algorithms. Money poured in. \"Phil became a very wealthy man in a very short period of time,\" Burg says. While Hildegard worked to keep business matters in check, Katz devoted nearly all his time to programming. He didn't come to work until late afternoon and worked well into the night, so he could have complete silence and not have to interact with anybody, early PKWare employees say. \"He was rarely around. He did what he had to,\" Kiehnau says. \"If the business would have went belly up two years after it started, I don't think he would have cared.\" But Katz's unpredictable schedule frustrated his family. \"They'd say 'You have this business, and it's growing. Why aren't you here?\" Kiehnau says. During his frequent absences, Katz kept in touch with Hildegard and PKWare executives through electronic fax services. He oversaw product upgrades and revisions, and occasionally gave Hildegard instructions on business matters. As his business grew, his personal life unraveled. Hildegard heard rumors her son was going to strip bars, cavorting with women and drinking heavily. She questioned him about his personal affairs, people who know the family say, and the relationship between the worried mom and wayward son began to fray. They also squabbled when Katz tried to take money out of PKWare. He sometimes wanted as much as $25,000, Kiehnau says. \"He thought it was ridiculous that a 30-year-old man would have to beg his mother for a check from his own company,\" Kiehnau says. Katz grew bitter over his mother's interference in his affairs. Eventually, he stopped talking to her altogether. The end came one day in 1995. Hildegard received a fax informing her that her son planned a hostile buyout of her 25% equity stake. He had fired his own mother. \"It was like a funeral the day it happened,\" Kiehnau recalls. \"It was his product, but it was her business. (Kiehnau's former wife) Cindi and I got called over to her house and she was crying and crying, 'Why would Phil do this?' \" That same year, Katz hired Robert Gorman as director of marketing and sales. Gorman had previously worked in sales for Frontier Technologies, a Milwaukee-based developer of Internet software. Gorman maintains that Katz continued to manage the company, but others close to the situation say Katz's day-to-day role was minimal. Although he signed off on major decisions and worked on product upgrades, the company was run by PKWare management, they say. Despite the turmoil, PKWare's business remained strong through the 1990s, says Richard Holler, executive director of the Association of Shareware Professionals in Greenwood, Ind. It is difficult to measure the company's market share because not all shareware users end up licensing the product. But even as Windows-based \"zip\" products nibbled into PKWare's sales, the company's business held up, he says. \"They are still a big player in the commercial marketplace. They have a lot of ongoing relationships with other software developers that use the PKZip compression algorithm within their own products,\" Holler says. At the time of his death, Phil Katz was remembered among the world's elite programmers for writing a truly revolutionary piece of software. But that single accomplishment, as significant and profitable as it was, couldn't save Katz's life. Alcohol Takes its Toll Katz talked freer, laughed harder, stayed up longer and dreamed bigger when he had a drink in his hand, friends say. Drinking brought a painfully shy man out of his shell. \"As soon as he started drinking, you could see a little smile on his face. That's when he could talk to people, or tell a joke. When he didn't drink, he would pick jokes apart. He would think really deep and wouldn't have as much fun,\" says Fischer, the dancer who met Katz in 1994 and grew fond of him. But the alcohol was ripping his life from its moorings. On May 7, 1991, as he was driving his 1990 Nissan 300ZX with plates that read PKWARE, a police officer ordered Katz to pull over. Katz was sitting in the driver's seat, his glassy eyes nearly closed, according to the police report. He was convicted of operating under the influence of an intoxicant. It was the first in a torrent of legal troubles. About a year later, Katz was again convicted of drunken driving. Between 1994 and September 1999, Katz was arrested five times for operating after suspension or revocation of his license. Records show that courts issued six warrants related to his driving, including two for bail jumping. Once the authorities starting looking for him, Katz started showing up at work a lot less often. \"He just disappeared,\" Hay says. \"Sometimes you would see him at trade shows, but that was about it.\" When Katz did go to work, the strain was evident, former employees say. \"He lived in a state of paranoia,\" says one former employee, who asked not to be identified. \"He thought that (WITI-TV Channel 6) across the street from us was watching him.\" Katz knew that if authorities were looking for him at PKWare, they probably were also trying to find him at the handsome, brown-brick luxury condominium he owned near Mequon Country Club. His neighbors, unaware of his legal problems, were baffled by Katz's reclusive nature. Many say they had never seen or met Katz even though he supposedly had lived there for almost five years. \"I never saw a light on, I never saw tire tracks in his driveway, and I live across the street. It was almost spooky,\" says Peter Picus, a neighbor. The condominium was in the eye of a publicity storm in August 1997 after neighbors complained about a stench emanating from the home and mice and insects scurrying near the unit. Mequon authorities obtained a search warrant to enter the condominium, after neighbors and inspectors were unable to locate Katz. They found a stinking mass of garbage, sex magazines, videos and sex toys like whips and chains, according to Kenneth Metzger, former general sanitarian for the City of Mequon. \"It was a mess. I had been in the business for more than 40 years, and it was one of the worst that I had seen,\" Metzger says. \"It was knee deep in garbage. There were bottles, cans and rotting fast-food stuff all over the place. Whatever happened to that man, he went off the deep end.\" Though Metzger and his crew knew little about the evasive Katz, they could tell that he was wealthy. Among all the rubbish, they found credit cards, money, a laptop computer and jewelry that had never been opened. Publicity about the discoveries hurt Katz deeply, friends say, and some say it marked the beginning of the end. \"When they raided his house, they exploited it and told everybody at his company about his fetish. His mother found out, everybody found out,\" Fischer says. \"He knew people would jump to conclusions about him,\" she says. \"He felt really violated. That's the day he completely stopped going into PKWare. He didn't want his personal life mixed in with his employees. Nobody really does.\" By this time, Katz's closest acquaintances were the dancers at the strip bars he frequented. Fischer says Katz showered her and other dancers with gifts, often taking groups of them with him to Las Vegas. Several of them accompanied him to the 1998 Comdex computer show there. \"I would sleep with him in the same bed. He never would touch or sneak a peek or anything like that,\" she says. \"Sometimes he would cry and be like, 'Hold me, Chastity.' You'd just have to hold him all night long.\" \"There was never anything dirty about him,\" she says. \"He was not a pervert. I swear on my Bible. He was the most harmless, most generous, unselfish guy I have ever known.\" Some of his stripper friends took advantage of his generosity, stealing his credit card numbers and buying things for themselves. It intensified his paranoia. Katz began to keep any receipt or piece of mail bearing his name or account numbers. He piled it all into the back of his 1991 Nissan Pathfinder. \"That Pathfinder was so disgusting. It literally had no back seat,\" Fischer says. \"It was papers from the ground up.\" Fearful of the arrest warrants, Katz kept on the move. In addition to the drunken-driving convictions, he had a half-dozen judgments against him from financial institutions totaling more than $30,000, court records show. Katz hopscotched along a strip of hotels near Mitchell International Airport, staying at one for three or four days, then moving to the next, usually less than a few hundred yards away. \"You know what he did? He sat in his hotel room every single day,\" Fischer says. \"The only time he got out of the hotel room was maybe to go have dinner.\" Fischer says Katz sometimes called her answering machine late at night, pleading with her to join him. During their conversations, he sometimes spoke candidly about his family, his company, and his childhood, Fischer says. He said that his separation from his mother and sister was difficult, and that he continued to send Hildegard flowers and e-mails, even though they hadn't talked since he fired her from the company. Through it all, Katz drank heavily. Fischer says he drank at least a liter of Rumple minze and two bottles of Bacardi rum a day. \"He would drink until he'd puke. We'd have to see this. I never was with an alcoholic where you'd have to see it. After a while it was starting to make us sick,\" Fischer says. \"We'd say Phil, you know, this is sickening. You're killing yourself, and we're watching you do it.\" Hildegard Katz says her son underwent treatment for alcohol abuse. \"We all tried to help. As with almost any alcoholic, the more you tell them to get some help, they begin to isolate themselves because they don't want to hear it,\" Hildegard says. \"I guess we really thought he turned the corner after he went through rehab.\" But he had not turned the corner. Fischer says she realized Katz was near the end when she visited him at a south side hotel a few weeks before his death. Clad in nothing but underwear, he was suffering from uncontrollable hiccups and burdened by a horribly swollen stomach. \"He took some Valium so he could sleep. That was the only time he could sleep,\" she says. \"Then he would have the alcohol shakes. I'd try to play computer games with him, but he'd run to the bathroom all the time.\" \"He was so bad to the point where he would start (urinating) in his pants involuntarily. His liver was just going. He was puking up blood,\" she says. After helping Katz change his pants, Fischer left Katz's hotel room. She never saw him again. Katz had been dead for two days before his body was found. PKWare employees learned of his death almost a week later. In the days that followed, the company was flooded with hundreds of e-mails offering condolences from software junkies around the world. Most had never met Katz but were aware of what he had done. Stories of his death were printed in such far-flung media as the London Times, the New York Times and abcnews.com. But the sadness was deepest for those who had suffered the longest as Phil Katz's life came unglued. Hildegard had to make the sad trip to identify the son she hadn't seen in five years. Later, she reflected on the loss. \"I get the e-mails people are sending, and it is amazing how many people say that even though they never met him or talked to him they are ever grateful for what he did. One man said he saved my butt many times. Phil was concerned with helping people. \"It is a tragic waste of such a very vital person, and of his energy and abilities.\" Appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on May 21, 2000.",

            "text": "Pebble shows us on how to manage competition with other smart watch like Android Watch or Apple Watch.\n\n\nThe main idea is to create a flexible platform that can be low as possible (the barebone minimum) and can also be build as magnificent as the developers want.\n\n\nFor example in this case Android Watch and Apple Watch comes a lot of features. These features will make their device hard to be scaled down. While in the other hand Pebble watch that start from the barebone minimum can easily adjust features of the smart watch and then the price.\n\n\nPretty clever explanation in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPebble is an open system that is not tied to either Android or Apple.\n\n\nIt can be used within both environment quite well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you take some features (in this example Pebble reduced the battery life) you need to make sure you give additional or more features.\n\n\nWhen the new Pebble created with reduced battery life than the previous Pebbles, the developers decided to add super charging feature that let the watch can be charged to 80% within 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this excerpt above, we can learn from Pebble that when making an operating system the user interface need to be regulated.\n\n\nEspecially in limited display like in Pebble watch.\n\n\nIn this scenario Pebble need to adjust by giving new guidelines for its developers to create interface of their Pebble watch application.\n\n\nHere is the link to the article, \nhttps://backchannel.com/pebble-is-trying-to-run-circles-around-apple-a87d96590d3\n.\n\n\nBelow is the full screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this link, \n, another article about Pebble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the link, it is known that the creator of Pebble was once studying in Deflt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe started his business when he was 21 years old.\n\n\nWent to Y Combinator.\n\n\nCreate Pebble.\n\n\nAnd now he is 30 starting his adulthood first time without the title of CEO.\n\n\nPebble was a lone hardware startup.\n\n\nFirst it was in a company named Alerta with a product named InPulse (also a smart watch).\n\n\nBelow is the predecessor of Pebble. The InPulse smart watch that usually paired with BlackBerry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chronological order of the down of the Pebble.\n\n\nIt just started on 2015 when it has no profit.\n\n\nSo, lesson learned from this is that if you are not making profit for a year probably you will have your company closed by next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Apple and Pebble misjudge the smart watch market.\n\n\nThe only thing that people uses with smart watch is the fitness tracking application.\n\n\nAnd neither of their smart watches have emphasize on this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis only regret on Pebble is that the smart watch did not come as a fitness tracker.\n\n\nApple also has this regret.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPebble was failed to raise money to develop their new line of smart watch application.\n\n\nThere are Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core along this line of those they did not have money to develop.\n\n\nThe solution? Kickstarter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hail marry schemes.\n\n\nUsually happen in small startup company.\n\n\nThis is to release employees up to the smallest amount possible (like 10 or so).\n\n\nSo, when I am going to work in s startup I must consider this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your company sunk, create some prioritizes on what to protect.\n\n\nFor example in Pebble case. The CEO prioritizes these.\n\n\nDevelopers.\n\n\nHis loyal employees.\n\n\nThe loyal customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPebble choose to be bought by fitBit because they promise Pebble to keep some of their customers and the developers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigicovsky left people not as a wealthy man.\n\n\nLink to the article, \nhttps://backchannel.com/the-real-story-behind-pebbles-demise-303802a7afaa\n.\n\n\nFull screenshot of the article.",

Or 3D as it is in computer generated movies.\n\n\nI think the \"3D\" here is more toward the latter, since this paragraph mentions about animators.\n\n\nIt says here, that 3D needs doing many calculations, handling big data, and precise calculations. And these are the main reasons why C is used instead of other programming language.\n\n\nEmbedded system also most of the time coded in C.\n\n\nThis is because embedded system has limited amount of storage.\n\n\nAnd C is used, because C programming language is deterministic about the memory allocation and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are these example of automotive embedded applications those are coded in C programming language.\n\n\nAirbag control.\n\n\nAnti - lock brakes.\n\n\nAutomatic stability control.\n\n\nAutomatic transmission.\n\n\nChild proof lock.\n\n\nClimate control.\n\n\nCruise control.\n\n\nDashboard display.\n\n\nHeated seats.\n\n\nKeyless entry.\n\n\nMemory for seats and mirror settings.\n\n\nSensors.\n\n\nTire pressure detection system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the programming languages used are different between brands.\n\n\nThe common back - end programming language used is still C.\n\n\nC offers these.\n\n\nCloseness to hardware while maintaining readability and efficient syntax.\n\n\nEfficiency.\n\n\nFlexibility.\n\n\nPerformance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe C programming language is still used because C allows developers to be productive with C for any kind of project.\n\n\nThe point above means that C has the portability.\n\n\nC has higher level language that provide much larger built - in libraries that simplify working with these.\n\n\nClient request.\n\n\nDatabase connection.\n\n\nJSON.\n\n\nMedia manipulation.\n\n\nUI.\n\n\nWeb pages.\n\n\nXML.\n\n\n....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 things those made C to be a definite choice are portability and efficiency.\n\n\nC is closer to any machine language than any programming language beside the Assembly programming language itself.\n\n\nC compiler can target almost all processor architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this reason, some of higher level programming languages have their compilers, library, and interpreter coded in C programming language.\n\n\nFor example.\n\n\nPython.\n\n\nRuby.\n\n\nPHP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples above has their tools coded in C.\n\n\nC was used to coded compilers because its closeness to machine language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother example would be C is used as an intermediate compiler between programming languages named Eiffel and Forth.\n\n\nC compiler offers another layer of interface for programming language instead of direct interpretation to machine language.\n\n\nSo these languages, have their codes interpreted into C codes that then access machine level operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC is very \"state of the art\" programming language.\n\n\nC has a manual memory manipulation like no other programming languages have (perhaps C++, but it is still C variant).\n\n\nC ability to address memory access and pointers is an important features for the development of system programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is this section about deterministic usage of resources.\n\n\nThis section is about a common programming language compiler/interpreter that rely heavily on its automatic garbage collection.\n\n\nHowever, for embedded system with low memory spaces, garbage collection sometimes takes some unnecessary memory spaces.\n\n\nSometimes, due to the limited, memory garbage collection and automatic memory allocation could not be called.\n\n\nProgramming languages those depend on automatic memory allocation and garbage collection would not be fit in resource limited systems.\n\n\nThis is where C can still be used.\n\n\nSo, when efficiency is a must, I should use C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the code size C has twice smaller codes when compared to C++.\n\n\nThe binary generated is twice as smaller as those generated from C++.\n\n\nThe main cause is due to its exception support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions are great tools added into C++ that is not exists in C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons to learn C.\n\n\nC is not a hard programming language.\n\n\nC is a lingua franca programming language.\n\n\nC is portable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning C benefit your further learning in programming language.\n\n\nIf you know codes in C you could easily implemented that codes into other programming languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Understand C, understand machine!\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many projects those are coded in C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Illuminati does not run the world, C programmers do.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC programming language does not seems to have an expiration date.\n\n\nI think this is because its closeness to hardware while maintaining human readable syntaxes.\n\n\nA programmer can write anything possible in C.\n\n\nThere are many specifics programming languages for specific needs.

            "text": "There is this article about 17 years old who got accepted into all Ivy League universities.\n\n\nHere is the link to the article, \nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/admissions-essay-all-ivy-league-schools-2017-4?international=true&r=US&IR=T\n.\n\n\nHere is his motivation letter.\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite time to run is at night.\n\n\nThis particular run in early August brought a break to the humid, muggy weather I left on the East Coast. I used my body as a human psychrometer, knowing that the cold feeling of evaporating sweat signaled much needed dry air.\n\n\nI cross over the bridge into Minnesota. Out of my three sports, cross country is definitely my worst \u2014 but I continue to be hooked on it. Unlike swimming and track, my motivation to run is heavily intrinsic. I live for the long runs I take on by myself. While they rarely happen during our season, we were assigned a long run to complete over our first weekend of cross country. In reality, I was supposed to go six miles, but felt eight gave me more time to explore the home I had just returned to. My mind begins to wander as I once again find my rhythm.\n\n\nMy train of thought while running is similar to the way one thinks in the minutes before sleep \u2014 except one has more control over how these thoughts progress and what tangents they move off of. While special relativity would be the \"proper\" thing to think about, especially at MITES, I revive the violin repertoire I had turned away from for so long and begin playing it in my head. I'm now at the edge of town in between the cornfields. The streaming floodlights on the open road give me a sense of lonely curiosity, reminiscent of the opening lines of Wieniawski's first violin concerto. I come up with adaptations of the melody in my head, experimenting with an atonality similar to Stravinsky's.\n\n\nI turn south onto a highway heading towards downtown. The dark night sky is broken by the oncoming light pollution. While I've longed for a road trip across the country, the neon lights from Sunset Lanes will have to do for Las Vegas. Turning west, I see a man and perk up as I try to look more menacing than I really am. But I relinquish. I realize that I did such an act simply because of the color of his skin. I kick myself for reverting to passive racism \u2014 something I spent much of the summer trying to overcome.\n\n\nThe bridge over Main Avenue leads me back into North Dakota and downtown Fargo. My city is on the eve of its annual pride week \u2014 the largest in North Dakota. Beyond the rainbow flags lining downtown, I see the Catholic cathedral I attend every Sunday outside of the summer. The juxtaposition brings back memories of trying to come to terms with my own beliefs. The conservatism on my mom's side of the family often clashes with the more liberal views of my dad's family. Fargo is known for its \"nice\" attitude, but the discussion of controversial issues is often set aside in favor of maintaining peace. On the surface this can be good, but it makes change a long and cumbersome process, and has caused me to become very independent in finding my own belief system \u2014 something especially difficult when these beliefs may have to do with your future identity.\n\n\nThe remaining part of my run is short and uneventful. The fact that the traffic lights have switched to blinking yellow and red means that I have been out later than usual. When I get home, I find that my run took somewhere around an hour \u2014 I honestly don't care about time during my distance runs. Longs runs are often seen as a runner battling the distance rather than time. But for me, long runs are a journey \u2014 both physically and mentally. Each time I run a route, I understand my surroundings and city more and more, and couldn't be more excited and sad to know that I'm leaving this place in a year's time.\n\n\n\n\nIt is actually amazing to have motivation letter to be like this, instead the traditional motivation letter.\n\n\nNext time I made a motivation letter it needs to be more personal.\n\n\nAside from those all Ivy League universities, he also got accepted into these universities.\n\n\nCalifornia Institute Of Technology.\n\n\nMassachusetts Institute Of Technology.\n\n\nStanford University.\n\n\nUniversity Of Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShit he is like 6 years old younger than me, but I am way outside his league. What to do :D????\n\n\nHere is the screenshot of the whole article.",
